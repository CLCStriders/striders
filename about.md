Welcome to the CLC Striders website, as you progress through the site you will see that we are a friendly competitive running club, based at the Cheltenham Ladies College Sports Centre. Open to all, we inspire and motivate our members to enjoy their running.

We hold organised training sessions on Mondays and Wednesdays throughout the year, and have an enthusatic and strong, men's and women's team racing on the road, track and cross country.

New members are always welcome to join us for training, either get in touch or just turn up.
