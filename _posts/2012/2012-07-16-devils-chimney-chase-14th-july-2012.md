With the start area swamp-like and worse conditions on the course promised by the race organizers, conditions were anything but favourable for quick times and the field felt smaller than previous years. 

Striders'Chris Driskell quickly took the lead and was joined by Andy Kaighin from Cheltenham Harriers. 

Driskell and Kaighin battled for the lead over the top of the hill before Kaighin broke away on the descent. 

However, with Kaighin looking a sure bet for victory, at the 5.5. mile mark he inexplicably went the wrong way handing the lead to Driskell. Driskell held onto this lead before falling spectacularly in an ungrippable area of mud shortly before the course returned to the road. The leading two were neck and neck in the final field before the 21 year old Kaighin outkicked the 34 year old Driskell on the final straight. 

The four other Striders enjoyed much more success in staying upright and had some excellent runs. 

Laura Kent finished first SL/35 and took the prize for second lady after a fine run finishing in 14th place overall; whilst Jon Bird had a strong run to take 15th place and show continued improvement on the mud. 

Paul Stonuary made the top 100, finishing in 97th place, whilst Dawn Addinall took the prize for first LV55 and enjoyed the race in the process. 

Sian Holley meanwhile accompanied a 2-strong contingent of junior Striders in the Stinger Mile.
