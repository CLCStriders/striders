<p>Jo Wilkie raced on Wednesday evening at the "Back in a Flash" 5km, Swindon</p>

"I was very pleased to be first Senior Lady in 20:37 (just 14 seconds behind the vet35 winner) in a big field of almost 160 competitors. Also pleased with the time over what is advertised as an Ëœundulating/flat' course - why didn't I read that description first?! The course takes in footpaths/trails around a lake, but also spirals up and over a pedestrian motorway bridge, and then back again, which definitely made it a bit tough!"
