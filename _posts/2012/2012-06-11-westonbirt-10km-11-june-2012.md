This midsummer race is held in the grounds of the world famous National Arboretum at Westonbirt near Tetbury. The course has two hills but is mainly flat and entirley traffic-free.It is run on well-surfaced woodland paths lined by the vast collection of specimen trees. The course is excellent for spectators as the nature of the route, enables runners to be seen several times.

Amelia Mullins ran well to finish first for the Striders, completing the course in 46.16. Beckie Boulton worked hard and stayed strong setting a new personal best time of 50.52. Nicola Christian followed close behind in 51.18. Well done!!
