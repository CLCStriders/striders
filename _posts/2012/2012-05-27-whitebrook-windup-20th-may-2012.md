Advertised as a 1/2 marathon, this was over 1km longer and a very tough course with 3050ft of vertical gain in total with 1200ft in 2 particular climbs that almost slowed me to a walk and tears at one point. Broke away from the lead pack at 7km to win by 2min 15sec with a time of 1hr 32min 10sec. Had the standard shoe related incident that I seem to have carried across from the cross country season - got stuck in some mud so I had to retrieve it 🙁 - didn't cost me any placings, just time. Perhaps if I do it next year I won't do the 120km round trip on bike 😉
