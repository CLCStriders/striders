<p>Striders start new year in style at Gloucester 5 mile race</p>


There were some strong performances and an impressive clutch of chocolate biscuits for the seven Striders who competed in the Gloucester New Year's day 5 mile race at the Pilot Inn in Hardwicke today.

On a mild and overcast morning th Striders contingent took up their places on on the start line alongside runners from a number of other local clubs for this out-and-back course.

Among them, there were welcome returns for Rachel Vines and Will Ferguson, both making their first appearance in a Striders vest for some time. And on the course where he had set a club record excactly one year ago, Ferguson returned to action in convincing fashion, to take 5th place in 27:45.

Next home for Striders was Billy Bradshaw whose time of 31:41 earned him 17th place and the M45 prize and he was closely followed by Laura Kent whose time of 32:00 earned her 19th place overall and 2nd place in the Ladies'race; and by Jon Howes who had a great run to earn himself a PB of 32:05.

Pat Woods followed Howes to take 30th place overall and 4th in the women's race in a time of 34:00 and shortly after her, the ever-consistent Nicholas von Benzon posted another sub-35 minute time finishing in 35th place in 34:47 and taking the M55 prize in the process..

In her first race since October, Rachel Vines completed the line-up in 40th place with a time of 36:27.

The Striders team of Laura Kent, Pat Woods and Rachel Vines took the Ladies prize and walked away with several packets of biscuits.

In a strong field, the race winner was Severn AC's Tim Dalton in a time of 26:16.
