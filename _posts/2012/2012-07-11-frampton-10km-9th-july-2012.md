The ladies team once again proved their strength in depth to take the team prize with Laura Kent (38.27 & 4th lady overall), Sian Holley with an excellent sub 40 minute PB of 39.45 in 6th, and Emma Skeen (42.13, 10th) making up the scoring team. Laura & Sian also won individual age group prizes. Another notable performance was Helen Howes who notched up yet another PB, her 5th of the year so far, this time slashing over a minute off her previous best to finish in 47.35. There was also the welcome return to action of stalwarts Nikki Smith & Amanda Steer who are recovering from injury. 

The men also performed well. Dave Smeath used his experience in his 5th running of this race and set off at a steady pace, eventually leading the team home in 16th place overall in a time of 37.30 having overhauled Jon Bird (38.06) and Rich Shardlow (39.06) who had both taken a more aggressive approach. Eddie Macklin (42.55), Paul Bryant (44.07) and Dave Mayo (45.16) all ran PBs, with Paul dipping under his previous best by just 1 second!
