On a cold and windy day Chris Hale (GPS) completed his half marathon as a prelude to the London marathon. The course was a flattish coastal route with lovely scenery, but a very strong headwind coming back for the last 4. Having started off far too fast Chris managed to get round in a respectable 1.21.40 (unofficial). Overall a good leadup to London.
