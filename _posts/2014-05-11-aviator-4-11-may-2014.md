Ferguson who led from start to finish is returning to top form. His winning time of 21.11 was excellent considering there were extremely windy conditions throughout the race.

Meanwhile Amanda Steer of CLC Striders put in a gutsy performance to win the ladies race. Steer who is returning from injury recorded a time of 27.38. Other notable performances from CLC Striders were from debutant Ollie Moseley who won the U-20 race, and from Will Miles who was first over 50 male finisher.

Congratulations to all who entered and took part. Thank you to our organisers and marshals, without who the race could not have gone ahead. And special thanks to our friends from around Gloucestershire for continuing to support the Aviator 4.
