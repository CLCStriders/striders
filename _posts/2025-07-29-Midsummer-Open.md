#### Midsummer Open 3 Report / 16th July 2025 

A muggy Wednesday evening in Gloucester produced strong results for our track athletes in the Midsummer Open meet at the Blackbridge Jubilee Athletics Track. 

The meet, hosted by Cheltenham & County Harriers, was well-organised as usual, with our CLC athletes competing in the A- and B- string 5000m races on the third evening of the summer series – which this year also doubled up as the County Champs for the track 5000m.

The B race was a CLC Striders tour de force, with podium spots enjoyed by James Endicott (in 18:17 – for VM45 County Gold) and Will Pearce (in 18:35 – for VM40 County Silver), both achieving Season Bests, while pushing Cheltenham & County Harriers out of the medals. 

Club coach Joel Freeland (in 21:07 – for VM40 County Bronze) continued his return to fitness. Sarah Bergdahl (in 22:20) brought home the senior female County Gold medal, an excellent complement to her performance in The Mile at Open 1 earlier in the month. 

Performance of the evening came from Joe Willgoss (in 16:30 – for VM35 County Bronze) who was the club’s sole representative in the A race, finishing 8th in an incredibly strong field to set a new 5000 PB on the track by five seconds.
