Meanwhile other good runs by the Striders B team were had by Jon Howes who finished 114th, Paul Lockyer, making his debut for the club, ran well to finish 125th, Phil Jowett 160th, Joel Freeland 209th and Super Vet 65 David James who finished in 215th place.

The Striders men were led home by the Brendan Ward coached athlete Will Ferguson who finished in 9th place in this high class field. Ferguson who was 13th going into the final lap of 2 miles ran strongly to overtake 4 runners and achieved his best ever league position. He was backed-up well by Iain Porter who finished 24th. James Oram followed in 49th, Jon Cooke had a great run to finish 65th with Chris Driskell, who is gradually returning to top form, finishing 70th. Completing the Striders men's A team was Mark Langman who dipped inside the top 100 to finish in 98th place. This saw the Striders men finish 8th team on the day. Striders go into the final fixture in overall 8th place. The Striders men are ahead of local rivals Gloucester AC and Severn, and only Cheltenham Harriers, who are in Division One, are doing better.

The club's aim this season is a top 6 finish so the club will have to battle hard in the final fixture to achieve this.
