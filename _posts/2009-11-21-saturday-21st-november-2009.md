In keeping with tradition there will be a Striders social night out after the Blackbridge Glos league Xcountry on Saturday 21st November. (Please let Brendan know if you plan to run &#8211; if you haven&#8217;t already done so).

As always everyone is welcome on the social whether your running during the day or not. This will also be the last social night out before our Xmas party and will be an ideal warm up!

Time & Location 8.00 &#8211; 8.30pm @ Copa (Back bar) Regent Street

Hope to see you there.

Chris
