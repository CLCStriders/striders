For anyone who has read my race reports before, you will be familiar with the blend of exaggerations, half truths and embellishments. That said, I can say with total sincerity that the weather conditions at the Fire Service College 10k in Moreton- in- Marsh were the worst I have seen in 15 years of competitive (and not so competitive) running! Pulling back the curtains on the morning of the race confirmed the worst that the weather forecast in the days prior to the race had predicted; howling winds, driving rain and COLD! 

Despite the evil conditions, on what had been expected to be a fast course with PB potential, there were still some outstanding performances by the Striders. Dave Mayo had the performance of the day, with an awe inspiring run, achieving a huge PB of 45.28 (28<sup>th</sup>overall, 5<sup>th</sup>V40) reflecting the dedication he has shown in getting fit and improving his performance over the past 2 years. This was an amazing 5 mins faster than his time on the same course in 2011 (in far more benign conditions.) Eddie Macklin, making his racing debut for the Striders, and also running his first ever 10k also posted a great time with 44.39 in 23<sup>rd</sup>place. Laura Finucane also knuckled down admirably and managed to finish in 55.21. However, it was Dave Smeath (me!) who led the team home in an excellent 6<sup>th</sup>place overall in 39.08. Smeath shrugged off the tactical manoeuvrings behind him as competitors sought to shield themselves from the worst of the wind over the long stretches of disused runway, encountered twice over the 2 lap course (basically by running behind his ample frame!), but he showed great determination, pulling away at 8k to finish comfortably clear.
