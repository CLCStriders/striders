Barry ran the first leg and recorded a brisk 30.44 which was the 58th fastest time of the day. He got the Striders off to a good start in 20th place over a hilly 5.5 mile course. Barry handed over to Gavin Jerman who finished 44th in 22.30, before handed over to Jon Cooke who finished 43rd in 34.14. Mark Langman was next up finishing 39th in 19.23 while Iain porter (37th in 32.36), Paul Lockyer (38th in 19.59), Chris Driskell (38th in 34.05) Phil Jowett (37th in 19.53), JJ Willson (39th in 20.48) Rob Bircher (38th in 20.42) with 11th man Martin Bick finishing in a time of 22.04. The men didn&#8217;t have a 12th man so didn&#8217;t finish in the team placings. 

Meanwhile the ladies team ran well to claim 20th place with Jo Wilkie running 20.34, Rachel Vines 21.00, Helen Howes 25.19, Amelia Mullins 22.16, Amanda Steer 21.07 while, finally, Hilary Mott tore round in 19.25. 

At the Forest of Dean half marathon Stuart Barr ran 1.37.35, Amelia Mullins 1.40.32, Gavin Jerman 1.44.36, Andrew Patterson 1.44.40,

Beckie Boulton 53.45 and Dave Mayo 1.56.25.  
Laura Gush, who is the Striders international ambassador for ultra distance running, has put in some great performances recently running a 19.59 5k, a 41.57 10k, a 1.27.32 Half marathon and a 3.17 marathon in Japan. Laura is training for the Marathon De Sables which is the world&#8217;s toughest race where you run over a marathon in the desert for 6 continuous days.

Well done all.
