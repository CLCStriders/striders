**The White Horse 5k series (1 of 4) 21 May 2009**

**<a name="Report"></a><a name="Report"></a>Report**

There were 8 CLC striders competing in the Whitehorse 5km road race, held in the village of Sandhurst on 21 May.</p> 

The team did the club proud by achieving personal bests and club records, demonstrating their continuing improvement as the club enters its second year of existence. </p> 

First home for the Striders was Richard Dare who appeared to make light work of the flat fast course, flying home in 16.52, a personal best.</p> 

The ever improving Chris ?GPS? Hale was next home in 18.33, smashing his personal best and obtaining a V35 club record, proving how his dedication in training is paying off.</p> 

Lee ?The Strongman? Burge also performed well. His gutsy effort saw him charge home in a more than respectable 18.58. </p> 

Super speedy Liza Barry was the first lady CLC Strider to finish in a club record breaking time of 20.24. She was closely followed by Angela Puffett in an impressive 21.12 and Emma Loverage in 24.29.</p> 

Also running was Darren Hale (19.45) and James Gibbs (19.52), both with strong performances.
