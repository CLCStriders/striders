**Stroud Half Marathon and Abingdon Marathon –  22 October 2017**

With Storm Brian all-but blown out, CLC Strider athletes got back to the roads on Sunday 22 October to tackle the Abingdon Marathon and the ever-popular Stroud Half Marathon.

Although still gusty from the west, conditions were near-perfect for long distance road running in Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, and, once again, Striders did themselves and their club proud.

Over the full marathon distance, **Gavin Jerman** achieved a PB time of 3:36:07, running a very well-judged race with remarkably even splits until mile-23. Also running was **Charlie Haward**, putting to rest memories of a challenging London marathon debut earlier in the year and registering a hard-earned PB time of 4:36:15.

Meanwhile, in their home county, a crop of Striders lined up to compete in the 36<sup>th</sup> running of the Stroud Half Marathon. **Paul Northup** and **Will Pearce** led the team home, running within sight of each other the entire race and securing top 50 finishes in times of 1:24:43 and 1:24:49 respectively. In a perfectly executed run, Northup clocked a Vet50 PB time and 3<sup>rd</sup> place in his age category.

Next home, just outside the 90-minute mark were **Alex Monro** and vet **John Willson** in 1:30:11 and 1:30:24 respectively. Monro’s was a half marathon PB. They were followed by the ever-improving **Helen Knight**, smashing her PB for the distance in a time of 1:34:21 as 8<sup>th</sup> F30 finisher, building on a strong performance across the country the weekend before.

**Hannah Monro** also achieved a half marathon PB, ducking in under 1 hour 45 minutes in a time of 1:43:52. While vet **Andrew Gage** ran a solid 1:46:18 after a few weeks away from racing and competition.

**Sophie Longmore** paced **Emma Abbey** to a time of 1:49:06, while **Amy Underdown** and Jill Hooper came in under two hours, in 1:54:25 and 1:57:55 respectively. Just outside two hours, but improving on her Cheltenham Half time by 10 minutes as she comes back after her first baby, **Claire Sansome** clocked 2:01:04.
