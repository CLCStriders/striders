Although it wasnâ€™t a hot day, the course was made unexpectly tough by the strong headwind on the second half of the course.

Chris â€˜GPSâ€™ Hale was first strider across the line. Chris ran a strong race completing the course in 1.22.32 Dave â€˜Smeathâ€™ Smeath was not far behind, and dispite running a very hilly half marathon only two weeks previously put in a more than decent performance achieving a time of 1.24.10

Other notable performances from the men came from local boy Joel Freeland, who flew round in a time of 1.28.35, Simon Dee in 1.36.16 and Philip Hodder in 1.45.00.

First lady home for the club was Jo Wilkie, who smashed her PB, and dispite running at Cardiff half marathon only one week ago ran amazingly to finish in 1.36.16. Lucy McNulty also ran well achieving a time of 1.41.49. Patricia Woods followed and swiftly completed the course in 1.45.55.
