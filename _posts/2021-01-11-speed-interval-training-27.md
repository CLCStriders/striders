With the latest Govt announcement and restrictions, unfortunately club sessions won't be able to take place any time soon. 

However, a weekly session will continue to be set by one of our coaches, which will be posted at the beginning of the week on here, our website and also emailed out. 

This weeks session set by Joel Freeland is:

* Run for 30 seconds @ Mile to 3k pace, then dial back to 10k pace for a further 2.5 minutes.
* 60-90 seconds walk recovery (shorter recovery for more advanced runners)
* REPEAT 5 to 8 times based on current fitness and ability (so 5 times is 15 minutes of effort, 8 times is 24mins)

Easy cool down jog and stretch to finish.

Please adhere to the rules, only train if you feel fit & healthy and remember you CAN train together with 1 other person outside - so please reach out to other members/friends if you want some company.

The Committee are also in the process of arranging some other activities/virtual events to keep us motivated and we will keep you posted on this.

Enjoy and Stay Safe.
