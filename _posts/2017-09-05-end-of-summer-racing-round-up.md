The end of the summer has seen Striders busy in action both at home and overseas. **Gareth Harries** ran the Durban Parkrun in South Africa on 19<sup>th</sup> August, finishing 9<sup>th</sup> out of 1,300 in a time of 19:13 and on the following weekend Harries ran in Mbabane, Swaziland, at 1,150m of altitude on a course which included dead ends, barbed wire fences, a whopping 70m elevation and a detour on the main road! Harries was 7<sup>th</sup> finisher in a time of 21:08.

**Tipton Open and BMC Regional Races**

Meanwhile, closer to home, two Striders travelled to the West Midlands for the Tipton Open and BMC Regional Races. **Paul Lockyer** opted for a 200m/400m double and continued his run of fine form on the track. Slightly shy of a season’s best with a solid 63.1 in the 400m, he had a storming race in the 200m where he equalled his PB with an impressive 27.2. **Rachel Vines** ran a solid 5:24.3 in the 1,500m.

**Gloucestershire County Track Championships**

The first day of September saw a good contingent of Striders travel to Gloucester to compete in the Gloucestershire County Track Championships. Over the mile distance, CLC vets excelled with new PBs for **Charles Goodwin** in an electric new club age record of 5:21:7, **John Willson** with another club age record of 5:39:3 and **Andrew Gage** in 6:11:9. For the seniors, **Joel Freeland** registered a season’s best time of 5:24:4 and **Will Fergusson** continued his scintillating track form, setting yet another PB in a fantastically fast 4:28:5, setting a new club age record in the process.

Later on in the evening, Striders raced over the 10k distance. **Iain Porter** led the senior men home in a new PB of 35:25:8. He was followed by **Alex Monro** in a PB of 39:28:1 and **Neil Broadbent** in a PB of 40:34:2. For the ladies, **Patricia Sturgess** bagged an impressive PB of 41:29:9, Rachel Vines clocked a solid 42:49:4. Vet **Amanda Steer** achieved a new PB and club age record of 43:35:2 and **Hannah Monro** also registered a PB time of 45:18:5.

At the end of the evening Striders entered teams in the ladies and men’s 4 by 400m relay events, with the women’s team finishing in 5:46:2 and the men’s team a respectable 4:16:7.

In the club’s internal summer track competition, Will Fergusson finished top of the tree overall after a fantastic season of PBs and club records and an average age grading of 83.34%.

**Parkrun &#8216;take-over'**

On the 2 September, CLC once again successfully ‘took over’ the volunteering duties at Cheltenham Parkrun. Managing the timing, marshalling, briefing, pacing, and recording they delivered a safe and successful park run for just over 500 runners in Pittville Park.

**Meteor Mile**

Later that day a handful of Striders made the short trip over to Staverton Airport to compete in the Meteor Mile on the runway there. They were led home by the vet men – with **Paul Northup** with a PB and club age record time of 5:26:8, **Chris Hale** with a PB and club age record time of 5:29:0 and **Paul Lockyer** in 5:32:7. **Gary Smith** registered 6:11:8, **Martin Bick** 6:15:5, **Bradley Coates** 6:16:4, **Gordon Bendall** 6:54:5 and **Charlie Haward**, after race directing the Parkrun in the morning, came in in 7:26:6.
