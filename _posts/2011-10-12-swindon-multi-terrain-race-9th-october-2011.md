Jo came 18thoverall out of 316 runners and was 5thfemale (2ndSenior Lady) in a time of 35:57 over a course which although advertised as 5m was actually closer to 5.3m.

Although there were a couple of other women in eyesight who Jo couldn't quite catch, overall Jo was pleased with her time and position.
