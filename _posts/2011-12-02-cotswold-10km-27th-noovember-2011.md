&#8220;The Cotswold 10km was described as a flat and  
undulating course, not sure where the flat bit was! It definitely was  
not a PB course but it was a good one. There were 165 runners 5 of  
which were Striders. 4 of us finished and I was told 1 got carted back  
by St John&#8217;s ambulance because he twisted his ankle. I&#8217;m not sure who  
this was but wish him a very speedy recovery.  
The 4 who finished were Laura Kent, Angela Puffett, Nicholas Von Benson  
and Dave Mayo. Laura came in 1st lady, 12th overall in a time of 41.26,  
followed by Nicholas in a time of 46.04, he was 45th overall, 61st (and  
13th lady) was Angela who set a PB on this course.. well done! and Dave  
then came 90th in a very reasonable time of 48.30.  
The race was scenic and very well organized. Though not generally a PB  
course I would definitely recommend it to fellow runners to try next  
year.&#8221;
