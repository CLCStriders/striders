In this popular race, now limited to 100 entries, the Striders contingent made up large proportion of the runners who assembled on the start line. It was tough going in warm, muggy conditions (a stark contrast to last year&#8217;s monsoon).

Despite the warmth, Nick Barry led the Striders men home in superb sub-16 mins, finishing 10th overall. JJ Willson smashed his PB coming in well under 20 mins. Rachel Vines, on her return from injury, was first Striders lady home. Claire Sansome and Denise Hallam also took significant chunks off their PBs for this distance. Clark Lawson enjoyed a first run out in this event, and will surely target a sub-21 in his next outing.
