Another busy week of racing for CLC athletes saw runners competing in races as far flung as **Sicily** and **Liverpool**!

The week began with four Striders competing up at the Tipton track at the BMC meeting on Tuesday 23 May. **Sam Baylis** ran a scorching 9:38 in the 3,000m, while, in the 1,500m, **Chris Driskell** posted 4:53, **Rachel Vines** got close to the five-minute mark in a superb time of 5:05, and **Karlien Heyrman** finished in 5:24.

On Wednesday 24 May, **Paul Northup** posted a new club age category record in the Gloucester 5k road race over at Haresfield, completing the tough course in 18:50. Vet **Gordon Bendall** also represented the Striders, finishing in a time of 24:27.

On Thursday May 25, stars of _Me and My Dog_ **Andrew Paterson and Betty** finished 3rd overall in the Forest of Dean Fountain Five (mile race) in the canicross class.

On Saturday 27th May, **Gareth Harries** flew the Striders’ flag in Uditore's second anniversary Parkrun in the Mediterranean heat of Sicily, finishing in a time of 20:02.

A day later, also over in Europe, **JJ Willson** completed the Brussels 20k in a time of 1:31:34 around a course with 304m of ascent and in 30+ degree temperatures.

On the same day, up in the north-west, family members **Janet Mustoe** and **Kyle Sollars** completed the Liverpool Half and Liverpool Marathon respectively. Both really enjoyed the outing, with Mustoe clocking 2:11:54 for her Half and Sollars – making his debut at the epic distance – coming in under the magic four hours in a time of 3:51:36 for his first ever marathon.

Closer to home, in Newbury, **Dan Harte** enjoyed a multi-terrain 10k, finishing in a time of 51.00. And **Edward Collier** completed the hot and hilly Dymock Half Marathon.
