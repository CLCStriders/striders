On a brand-new course for the Gloucestershire League, the CLC ladies and men's teams lined up up to compete in the last local cross country race of the 2022-23 season. The course was run around farmland surrounding the Over Farm visit attraction just west of Gloucester. After weeks with no rain, the ground was rock solid and many of the runners opted for trail or even road shoes over spikes!

First, it was the turn of the ladies, in first place in the Masters team standings going into the event. Once again, Helen Knight led the team home as the second LV40 finisher and in 18th place overall. Hot on her heels was Liza Bradshaw as the third in her LV35 category and in 22nd overall. Kate Telford and Rachel Vines were next to finish in quick succession, both finishing fourth in their LV35 and LV40 categories respectively – and in 30th and 32nd place overall.

Next home in this race was club super-vet David James, who finished first in his MV70 category on the day with a very strong run against his main age -group rivals. Amelia Mullins finished second in her LV50 category on the day. The other three finishers for the CLC Striders ladies were Rebecca Reynolds, Emma Abbey and Charlie Haward.

Overall, the ladies Masters team comfortably held onto their gold medal position in the team standings for the season – emerging as the strongest Masters team in the county yet again. And, individually, Kate Telford won the bronze medal for the season in her LV35 category, Helen Knight won a silver medal for the season in her LV40 category and Amelia Mullins took gold for the season in her LV50 category.

Next, it was the turn of the men. With the majority of men’s team having focussed on their Birmingham League promotion efforts this season, and now deep into spring marathon training, only five runners lined up. First home for the club was Paul Northup in 84th place overall. He was followed by Joel Freeland, who despite not feeling his best, battled round for a top 100 finish, too. The other finishers on the day were Eoin McQuone, Mike Speke and Colin Upton.

Thoughts now turn to the inter-counties cross country champs next weekend near Loughborough where CLC athletes Liza Bradshaw, Kate Telford, Rachel Vines, Rob Green and Tom Burgess will running for Gloucestershire.
