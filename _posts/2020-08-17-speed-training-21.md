* 2 x 3 minutes @ 5-10k pace
* 2 x 5 minutes @ 10k pace
* 2 x 3 minutes @ 5-10k pace
* 2 x 1.5 minutes @ 5k pace 
* All with 90 secs walk recovery between reps and 3 minutes recovery between sets

Hydrate well, maintain 2 metres distance from others and don't be a litter bug - oh and maybe bring a towel as it may be wet.....
