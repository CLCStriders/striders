On Tuesday 13 July our very own Mens Captain, [Will Pearce, and his close friend Nathan Hambrook-Skinner](/images/2021/07/2021-07-16-Bob-Graham-4.jpg "Will Pearce and his close friend Nathan Hambrook-Skinner") challenged themselves to run across all 42 of the Lake District's highest fells, following the route first set by [Bob Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Graham_Round "Bob Graham") in June 1932. 

Bob Graham set a target of 24 hours to complete the entire route, which involves over 60 miles (100 km) with almost 30,000 feet (8,200m) of ascent. [Will and Nathan](/images/2021/07/2021-07-16-Bob-Graham-8.jpg "Will and Nathan") aimed to complete the full circuit as quickly as they possibly can. 

The route - often called the “granddaddy of ultra distance mountain routes” and arguably the first of its kind anywhere in the world - begins at Keswick and takes in Skiddaw (931m), Blencathra (868m), Nethermost Pike (891m), Scafell (964m and England’s highest mountain), and Great Gable (899m).

The challenge was in aid of the [Dear Toby Trust](https://thedeartobytrust.org/ "Dear Toby Trust") which was established in 2017, in memory of Toby Hambrook-Skinner who passed away at Great Ormond Street Hospital after an epic battle with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. He was just seven months old. Toby was diagnosed at eight weeks and began an aggressive treatment plan. Toby’s family and friends have set up this charity to find new ways to treat rare cancers and reduce the suffering of children enduring cancer treatment.

Starting at 0500, Will and Nathan set off from Keswick Moot Hall, [returning in elation](/images/2021/07/2021-07-16-Bob-Graham-5.jpg "returning in elation") 2 days later with legs truly feeling the effect of running/walking on such arduous terrain.

Will and Nathan have raised a fantastic £2,605 to date for the [Dear Toby Trust](https://thedeartobytrust.org/ "Dear Toby Trust").

The runners were inspired by Toby's fearless spirit to test their own fitness and resolve, and to add to his enduring legacy by raising more funds to help other seriously ill children.

Huge congratulations to Will and Nathan for completing this incredible challenge for such a worthy cause.
