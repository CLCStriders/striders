Congratulations to Liza Bradshaw and Rob Bircher who are our Striders of the Month for July 2022.

Liza and Rob completed the epic Lakeland 50 Ultra Marathon at the end of July, starting in Dalemain in the north Lakes and finishing in Coniston, with roughly 10,000ft of elevation.

Liza finished 38th overall and 5th lady in a time of 9:57:54 and Rob finished 500th in 14:36:39 in a field of over 1300.

Monumental efforts......well done.
