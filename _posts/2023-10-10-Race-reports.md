Once again, CLC Striders athletes were in action across a range of events this last weekend in conditions and temperatures which still felt more like summer than early autumn.
 
### Saturday 7th October 
 
#### Barrows and Downs Trail Marathon, Wiltshire
In another epic adventure, club ultra-man Rob Bircher completed the Barrows and Downs Trail Marathon in Wiltshire – complete with its 5,000+ feet of elevation – in a time of 5:46:21.

### Sunday 8th October 
 
#### Cricklade 10k and Half Marathon
Closer to home, and in his first ever outing over the 10k distance, club talisman Rob Green took first place in the Cricklade 10k in a time of 32:57, bagging himself a PB and toppling a 10-year-old club MV40 club record to boot. Meanwhile, over the half marathon distance, and making his debut for the club, Ben Cooper finished in seventh place in a PB time of 83:51.
