Congratulations to Helen Howes who is our Strider of the Month for June 2021. 

Helenâ€™s consistent and strong training throughout June culminated in her achieving an excellent 10k PB of 46:24 at the Frampton 10k at the end of the month, for 9th in her category. 

Helen followed this by running a brilliant Leg 1 of the Cotswold Way Relay, finishing 2nd lady and helping the ladies team to their best ever 2nd overall finish.

Well done Helen, keep it up!
