The weather forecast had looked ominous all week as a large group of CLC Striders geared up to run in their hometown half marathon. In the end, the morning dawned overcast but calm, and apart from one shower 20 minutes into the race, the event was dry.

On the day, the standout performance from a CLC athlete came from **Charles Goodwin**, who came first in his Vet 50 category in a time of 1:22:36 and 33<sup>rd</sup> overall. A fantastic achievement.

Next home for the club, making is debut in a CLC vest was **Mark Fuller**, who ran a perfectly judged race to duck in under his desired target time in a PB of 1:24:42. He was followed home by **Chris Driskell**, trying out over a longer distance than usual and running a well-paced race which saw him finish strongly in **1:27:13**. In sharp contrast, **Paul Northup** went out well but faded badly in the last five miles to finish as sixth male 50 Vet in a time of **1:27:56**. **Tom Vickers** also ran really well to come in under the one-hour-30-minute mark, in a time of 1:29:13.

Striders finishing in the next 10 minutes were vet **John Willson** in 1:31:15, **Neil Broadbent** in 1:32:22, and **Alex Monro** in 1:34:36. The first Strider ladies home were led in by **Patricia Sturgess** in 1:36:28, with **Amanda Steer** finishing second in her Vet 45 category, not far behind in 1:37:17. The returning **Philip Jowett** turned in a strong 1:37:36 and the ever-reliable **Gavin Jerman** ran evenly to duck in under 1:40 in a time of 1:39:57.

The remaining Striders finishing the Cheltenham Half were: **Stuart Barr** in 1:42:05, **Ed Thompson** in 1:42:52, **David Orme** in 1:43:14, **Mike Crossley** in 1:44:38, **Gary Smith** in a new PB of 1:45:35, **Hannah Monro** in 1:47:22, **Kyle Sollars** in 1:48:28, **Emma Abbey** in a course PB of 1:50:31, **Josie Parkinson** in 1:50:47, **Laura Fletcher** in a course PB of 1:51:31, **David Street** in 1:52:08, **Christopher Thomas** in a new PB of 1:52:58, **Daniel Farrelly** in 1:53:15, **Amy Underdown** in 1:53:38, **Dan Harte** in 1:53:51, **Gareth Harries** (dressed as a chicken and carrying a fundraising bucket!) in 1:55:25, **Carla Quirighetti** (in her first post-baby half) in 1:57:13, **Charlie Haward** in 1:57:19, **Martin Bruton** in 2:00:10, **Sue Clark** in 2:02:09, **Claire Sansome** (in her first post-baby half) in 2:12:55, and **Bradley Coates** in 2:37:48.

But it wasn’t just the racers. Striders were also volunteering for the event, with **Martin Bick** and **Janet Mustoe** marshalling on the streets of Cheltenham.
