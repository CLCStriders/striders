A very special thanks goes out to everyone of you who represented the Club at the White Horse 5k road race. We had 26 competitors - unbelievable! This was an historic day as it's the first time the Club has officially competed as a team and I am very proud of you all. I cannot thank you enough for all your efforts and support - it is greatly appreciated indeed.
