Congratulations to John Willson who is our Strider of the Month for July 2021.

JJ has been in brilliant form over the last few months and proved this throughout July setting 6, yes 6, new Club Records (M60-64).

To start with on the 7th July JJ ran a blistering 5:53 Mile on the POW track! JJ improved on this time on the road a few days later at the Bourton Mile race with an incredible 5:38 mile for another club record and 1st MV55 in the county.

He then ran an excellent 1:52.5 for 600m on the track on the 14th July.

Two weeks later on the 21st July, JJ ran an amazing 19:22 5k again at the POW track. 

JJ set his next age category club record at the Shepperdine 5 mile road race in a time of 32:47 (this was age graded adjusted race putting him 10th overall with an adjusted time of 26:26!!). His 6th and final record of the month was again on the POW track, running 68.3 for 400m

JJâ€™s current road mile time of 5:38 ranks him 2nd V60 in the UK! Amazing. 

Just incredible running and very well deserved.

Well done JJ.
