The committee continue to review the situation around Covid-19 and all training sessions remain cancelled until further notice. We must continue to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our members, especially true for those with caring responsibilities, and members who have elderly relatives or those in other vulnerable groups, and be aware of the risk of the virus being spread at club led events.

At this stage it is unknown if races will take place this year, England Athletics have cancelled all events until the 30 June and we anticipate an update in due course in regards to events after this date.

We continue to recognise the importance of running for both the physical and mental wellbeing of our members so encourage you to continue running alone. We also recognise the importance of keeping in contact with members and maintaining virtual interaction, to enable this:

* Club coaches are producing weekly speed training sessions which will be shared with members for those who would like to continue to do the sessions independently 
* Club Captains are currently considering the next virtual race event – more information shortly
* A really successful virtual quiz event took place on Friday 1 May – consideration will be given to potential future virtual events

Can we remind you all of the UK Government advice to support the UK's response by:

* following public health authorities' advice, for example on [hand washing](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/best-way-to-wash-your-hands/)
* reducing the impact and spread of misinformation by relying on information from trusted sources, such as that on [www.nhs.uk](http://www.nhs.uk/), and [www.gov.uk](http://www.gov.uk/)
* checking and following the latest [FCO travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus) when travelling and planning to travel
* ensuring you and your family's [vaccinations](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/nhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/) are up to date as this will help reduce the pressure on the NHS through reducing vaccine-preventable diseases
* checking on elderly or vulnerable family, friends and neighbours
* using NHS 111, pharmacies and GPs responsibly, and go to the hospital only when you really need to. This is further explained on the NHS website  - [When to go to A&E](http://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergencycare/when-to-go-to-ae/)
* being understanding of the pressures the health and social care systems may be under, and receptive to changes that may be needed to the provision of care to you and your family.
* accepting that the advice for managing COVID-19 for most people will be [self-isolation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-self-isolation-for-patients-undergoing-testing/advice-sheet-home-isolation) at home and simple over-the-counter medicines.
* checking for new advice as the situation changes.

We thank you all for your understanding and continued support of the club at this difficult time. If you have any questions or concerns please email <secretary@clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk>.
