Hilary Agate and Jo Wilkie were in action in the women's race and with conditions fine, a fast race was on the cards. The two Striders ran a well-paced race, and both ended up with excellent times. In the end it was Agate who edged it in a new club record of 5:46.9 to claim 6th place with Wilkie following shortly behind in 5:47.4 in 7th place.

Joel Freeland and Rich Cannock were representing Striders in the other mile race. Having recorded a strong mile time on the road at Bourton at the weekend, Cannock was away quickly and set a rapid pace over the first three laps. Despite dropping off the pace slightly, he held on well to finish in 7th place in another strong time of 05:07.07. Freeland meanwhile ran an evenly paced race to finish in 11th place in 05:23.4.
