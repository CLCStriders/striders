It was a really well organised event on a fairly flat, but interesting, course taking in the villages of Ashchurch and Bredon before heading back to the rugby club. Nearly 1000 people participated on a very hot day for running. Rob achieved an excellent PB of 1.42:16 finishing 198th. Sue also smashed her PB setting a new record of 2.00:36. There&#8217;s was a disappointing lack of snacks in the finish bag and there were problems with the sizing of t-shirts, but overall it was an excellent event.

Well done both!
