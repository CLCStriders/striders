### Speed Work &#8211; Wednesday 6.30pm CLC Sports Centre

Speed work is for all abilities; it is a common misconception that it is only for the pros. Recreational runners will see tangible benefits in their fitness and performance. We have two groups; an improvers group and a competitive group:

Improvers Group: This group is designed for athletes who may not yet feel confident enough to compete for the club, especially in X Country league fixtures, but who want to improve their running. The aim of this group is to help members to achieve their running goals; to compete if they wish to do so, and progress to the Competitive Group.

Competitive Group: This group is is designed for athletes who predominantly do compete and who want to fly the flag for the club especially in X Country league races, and for those who really want to become the best they can be at their selected distance. The sessions, especially over the winter months, will be progressive in volume and will have lots of variation.
