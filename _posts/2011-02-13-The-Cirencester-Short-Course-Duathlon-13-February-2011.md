**Report**On Sunday 13th February Jon Gould won the Cirencester Short Course Duathlon! The race was an off-road combination of running and mountain biking: 1 mile run - 5 mile bike - 1 mile run. The course was incredibly muddy, which made going tough, but Jon managed to pull away on the bike leg to come home in a time of 39:02, over one and a half minutes ahead of second place.
