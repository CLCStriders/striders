CLC Striders had a large showing at this year's Stroud Half Marathon. <!--more-->

The club were led home by veteran John Willson who remained strong throughout the race and came home in a sub-1.30 for the 13.1-mile course with Willson also setting a new club V55 record.

Many CLC Striders set personal bests for this popular race with Ladies Club Captain Rachel Vines leading the ladies home cruising round in a sub-1.40 clocking. Vines, who was nursing a hip injury, ran cautiously throughout the race and saved herself for the second County Cross Country league fixture held at Malvern next Saturday.
