The club are pleased to announce that Amelia Mullins is awarded the &#8220;Strider of the Month&#8221; accolade for January 2016.

Amelia who has recently taken over the Treasurer duties on the club committee, is a strong and regular member of our ladies Cross Country team for the last few seasons.

This year, she has proven to be a force to be reckoned with on the road with recently setting a LV40 5 mile club record at the Lind Franks race.
