This is a great race of 10 miles across beach, some road and then into the forest. Ross completed the 10 miles in 1hr 18mins 16secs and came 217 out of a field of 822 runners and produced a great sprint finish to pip another competitor to the line.

Natalie was also pleased with her performance coming in in a time of 1hr 34mins 59secs and finishing 613.

In Ross&#8217;words &#8211; a well marshalled, well-organized and highly recommended race!</p>
