The event is seen as one of the major warm-up events for next month's London Marathon and attracts a large, high quality field. It also gives runners the experience of a big stadium finish at the Madejski Stadium, home of Reading FC.

First home for the Striders was on form Jon Howes in 1.28.21, in 514th place overall out of a field of nearly 13,000. This was faster than last year's time but some way below his PB. Jon struggled with the after effects of a chest infection and described the conditions on the day as &#8216;a vile experience.'Helen Howes fared better, sneaking under her previous PB by 2 seconds with 1.47.03, showing great determination towards the end when conditions were becoming increasingly unpleasant. Rob Bircher also performed well with 1.46 exactly, smashing his course record of 2.30 achieved in 2010. Andrew Jones completed the quartet with 1.58.51.
