  <span >A large group of CLC Striders took part in the Frampton 10k last Monday.  On a fine summer’s evening, the relatively flat and rural course provided some impressive times as the Striders were led home by Will Pearce in an excellent 14th place in a time of 37:20.  He was swiftly followed by Jon Howes in 37:39 finishing second MV40 and 16th overall and Paul Lockyer in 39:52 (34th).  First lady home for the club was the ever-improving Karlien Heyrman with a new personal best of 40:25; Heyrman finished as 5th lady in 42nd place overall. </span>
