After a season of tame running conditions, proper cross-country arrived for the final fixture of the Gloucestershire League. Runners slipped and fell at various points of the course and the notorious stream crossing in Pittville Park provided some entertainment for the onlookers, with a few runners taking a cold plunge.

Nine Striders competed in the Senior Womenâ€™s race. First scorer for CLC Striders was Kate Telford, finishing in a time of 29:33 and second in her LV35 category. Helen Knight followed, as first LV45 in 30:04 and in doing so capped off the season by claiming the age group category gold medal.

Ellie Pudifoot battled well, despite illness, finishing in 31:20. Karlien Heyrman, racing for the first time in five years was fourth Strider home in 31:23. Fiona Brady-Miller, in great form, was second LV45 in 32:23. Completing the club contingent were Sarah Bergdahl 35:26, Nicola Weager 36:30, Rebecca Reynolds 39:00 and Emma Abbey 40:50.

It was then the turn of the men, with thirteen Striders lining up to do their best. The club were led home by Rob Barnett, despite a fall on the first lap, in 41:13, James Endicott was second club finisher in 43:22, Richard Aarons third in 44:55 and hot on his heels as fourth scorer in 44:56 was Liam Richardson.
