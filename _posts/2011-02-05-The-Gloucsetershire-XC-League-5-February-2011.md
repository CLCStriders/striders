**Glos Cross Country League 05 February 2011**

 </p> 

**Report**

A great effort by all who competed in the final glos league cross country league fixture of the season held at plock court. The Club came away as Women's overall league champions for the second successive year, and the Men finished in an excellent 3rd place in the overall league standings.

Individually well done to Liza Barry who finished in 2nd place overall in the league standings, and to John Parker who was also second overall in the Men's competition.

Thanks again for making me a very happy Bunny.

Brendan
