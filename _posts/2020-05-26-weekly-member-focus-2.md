Each week we are going to share an update on a member of the club and the activities they are undertaking to keep running during lockdown. This week we focus on **Fiona Brady-Miller**.

Fiona should have been running the London Marathon on Sunday 26 April in support of CLIC Sargeant Children's cancer charity - due to the current restrictions she, like many others, was prevented from doing so. Fiona has raised a huge amount of money for CLIC Sargeant running charity events including a quiz which many members of CLC Striders attended.

Fiona wanted to put all the hours of intensive training to good use so ran up and down her street 26 times, receiving support from family and neighbours whilst she did.

Fingers crossed the London Marathon will take place on Sunday 4 October 2020.

Well done Fiona, keep up the amazing work and look forward to seeing you run your first London Marathon.
