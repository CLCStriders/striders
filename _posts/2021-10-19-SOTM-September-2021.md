He’s at it again........ Congratulations to our Strider of the Month for September 2021, Rob Bircher.

In September, Rob competed in the Cotswold Way 100. He ran the entire Cotswold Way in one hit, all 102 miles starting in Chipping Campden & finishing in Bath, in a time of just 29hours 19minutes (pictured here at the finish in Bath).

Sheer strength of body & mind, in what he described as his “toughest race to date” (which says a lot!) in warm conditions. 

Well done Rob, epic achievement.
