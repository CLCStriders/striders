Congratulations to Amelia Mullins who is our Strider of the Month for November.

Amelia kicked off her cross country season at the start of November with an excellent run at Cirencester Park where she finished 98th overall and 1st in her age category in Race 1 of the Gloucestershire League. She then followed this up with a cracking run at the first Midland League XC Race in Stoke, finishing 38th and helping the Ladies Masters team into 2nd on the day. 

On the 20th November, Amelia took to the cotswold trails to complete the very hilly & challenging Broadway Trail Marathon in an excellent time of 5:13:11 to finish 71st overall and set a LV50 multi-terrain marathon club record.

On top of all this, Amelia continued to coach club sessions throughout November in some dismal conditions which we are all very grateful for! Thanks Amelia and well done.
