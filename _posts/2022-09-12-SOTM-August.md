Congratulations to Adam Greenwood who is our Striders of the Month for August 2022.

Adam has consistently been at Striders sessions over the past few months and this focused training resulted in Adam breaking the 20min barrier for 5km at the Haresfield Gloucester 5K in August, running an excellent 19:53 PB. Adam also played his part in the Striders Men's team victory with a strong run in tough hot conditions at the Bugatti 10k in August. 

Adam also smashed the Cheltenham Half last weekend with a new half marathon PB time of 1:35:10. 

Plenty more to come from Adam too with the rate he is improving. Well done
