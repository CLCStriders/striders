In light of changes in the Government advice today, the committee has taken the unfortunate, but necessary, decision to cancel all club led training sessions on Monday and Wednesday evenings for the foreseeable future. We must heed this advice and safeguard the health and wellbeing of our members.

However, we recognise the importance of running for both the physical and mental wellbeing of our members so we want to do our bit to encourage you to continue running either alone or in small groups.

We will be publishing weekly speed training sessions on the website for those who would like to continue to do the sessions independently.
 
The road relays due to take place on Saturday have been canceled and a decision will be taken re parkun on Wednesday.
 
We appreciate that this news is far from ideal and we thank you all for your understanding and continued support of the club at this difficult time.

If you have any questions or concerns please email <secretary@clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk>.
