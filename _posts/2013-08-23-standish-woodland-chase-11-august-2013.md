The almost 10 mile course starts on road and climbs steeply for just over a mile until you reach the woods which include part of the Cotswold way. Although the sun was out the woods created enough shade to make cool conditions. The competitors ran two laps of the undulating woods, Vines in constant fear of being lapped by her club colleague. Luckily that didnâ€™t happen and the pair ran well. Driskell finishing in 5<sup>th</sup>place in a time of 1:03:44 and Vines in 62<sup>nd</sup>position overall (12<sup>th</sup>female) in a time of 1:20:42
