In the fourth and final midsummer open at the Prince of Wales Stadium, three Striders turned up to represent their club. First up was Joel Freeland. Having recently equalled the club 400 metres record, this time he decided to take on the 800 metres.

Joel ran with characteristic strength from the outset and went through the bell in a time of 65 seconds, well on course for a time between 2:10 and 2:15. The next 200 metres saw Joel slow down somewhat, but in typical fashion, with 150 metres to go he produced a powerful change of pace to finish strongly crossing the line in a PB time of 02:11:6.

Next up was John Parker in the mile. In a strong field, JP made a decisive start and spent much of the race engaged in a battle with Cheltenham Harriers' Ed Grazier. After an even paced-race, JP accelerated down the home straight and only very narrowly missed out on a sub 4:30 finish, settling for a new club record for the mile of 04:30.9.

Last to run for Striders was Rich Cannock who, on the comeback trail from injury, took part in the final mile race of the evening. Rich made a positive start and set a strong pace, and although he suffered in the latter stages of the race, he battled on bravely and crossed the finish line in 05:33.4.
