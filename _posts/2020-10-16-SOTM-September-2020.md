Congratulations to Liza Bradshaw who is our Strider of the Month for September 2020.

Liza trained incredibly hard throughout September (& the many months before!) building towards her Marathon at Dorney Lake, regularly running over 70miles/week, with a lot of hills.

This dedicated training led to a brilliant run at the Cheshire Half Marathon (finish pic below) where she ran a fantastic PB time of 1.23.14 for 4th lady! In September, Liza also ran a 5mile TT round Boddington in 31minutes, which was also a PB (virtual).

All of this focused training & racing throughout September culminated in Liza running an incredible Marathon at Dorney Lake on the 4th Oct, in tough windy & wet conditions, in an amazing time of 2.54.59 - a PB and new club record.

Very inspiring and very well deserved...well done Liza Bradshaw.
