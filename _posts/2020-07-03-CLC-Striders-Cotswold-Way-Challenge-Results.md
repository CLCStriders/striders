An enormous well done to everyone that took part in the CW Challenge in June; a total of 17 runners submitted their results. 

The grand total of miles run on the Cotswold Way in June was...... 865.5 miles! This is the equivalent of 8.4 times the length of the Cotswold Way Relay, or 84 relay legs.

Everyone did extremely well, but a special mention must go to [Rob Bircher](/images/2020/07/2020-07-03-Cotswold-way-3.jpg "Rob Bircher")
 who completed an astonishing 164.5 miles on the CW in the month. [Paul Lockyer](/images/2020/07/2020-07-03-Cotswold-way-4jpg "Paul Lockyer")
 and [James Babbage](/images/2020/07/2020-07-03-Cotswold-way-2.jpg "James Babbage")
 also clocked up a tremendous 102 miles each, with Liza Bradshaw completing 90 miles and [Helen Knight](/images/2020/07/2020-07-03-Cotswold-way-5.jpg "Helen Knight")
82 miles. 

In the Virtual Trail Half Marathon, Will Pearce was first man with a time of 1:41:11 and Liza Bradshaw was first lady in 1:42:01. However, the run profiles differed quite a bit (although all were hilly) and some people ran over distance, which means it's difficult to compare the runs. 

Thank you for taking part in this challenge, hopefully it has reminded us how lucky we are to have routes like the CW on our doorstep.
