Pick of the crop was Andrew Jones who ran a superb race in the Bath Half. Jones smashed his PB and also set a CLC Striders MV35 Club record to boot recording a time of 1.17 and finishing 76th overall in this high class field of 10,000 runners. New signing Juan Moreno Elias announced his arrival at the club with a sensational PB of 1.22 finishing in the top 200. Other notable performances included James Coull who ran 1.34, Rich Cannock who helped pace Vicky Lewis round in 1.35 and Emma Abbey who smashed he PB by more than 8 mins to finish on 1.46.

Meanwhile, over at Silverstone, Clark Lawson took more challenging option of running around the famous circuit rather than driving. It paid off handsomely as Clark scored a PB of 1.43.

Just down the M4, half a dozen Striders were at Madejski Stadium for the Reading Half. In a record turnout of more than 14000, the start was delayed for 10 minutes to allow everyone to get to the start line on time. Jon Bird led the Striders home in 1.37 with Rob Bircher beating last years time by 3 mins to finish in 1.43. Rachel Marlow came in under 2hrs for the first time in a super 1.56 with Claire Sansome and Kathryn Hole finishing in 2.02 and 2.03 respectively. Dan Harte was running his fourth Reading Half and recorded his third consecutive finishing time of 1.54 on this course.

Well done to everyone representing our club this weekend.
