**Stroud Half Marathon  
** **Sunday 21 October 2018**

On a perfect morning for distance running, a crop of Striders assembled to race the annual Stroud Half Marathon. With the biggest field in its history, the event once again provided some great results for club athletes.

First home for the Striders was **Will Ferguson**, continuing his fine form in his year of PB-setting by clocking a new club record and PB time of 1:11:00 dead, for sixth place overall. Next home, running his third half marathon in just a month, was **Will Pearce**, in a solid 1:22:43 and 39<sup>th</sup>place. He was followed home by **Jon Howes**, who surprised himself with a quick time of 1:24:15 and **Alex Monro **who ran a second PB in just a few weeks of 1:28:13.

**Helen Knight **was the first lady home for the club, once again only just outside the magic 1:30 mark in a super time of 1:30:43. Helen was followed home by the club’s second lady finisher, **Sarah Richards**, in a PB time of 1:30:52. The next Striders finisher was **Paul Northup**, continuing his return from injury with a 2-minute improvement on his Cheltenham Half time in 1:31:28. In only his second half marathon, **Eoin McQuone **clocked a solid 1:33:39 and super-vet **Edward Collier **finished in 1:35:55. **John Willson **completed his third half marathon in just a month in a time of 1:39:48.

**Javid Norat **finished in 1:41:06, **Andrew Gage **ran a PB time of 1:44:31, **Kyle Sollars **clocked 1:52:00, **Emma Abbey **finished in 1:57:20, **Jill Hooper **registered 1:59:55, **Sue Clark **finished in 2:00:14, and **Dave Mayo**, in his first race for two years after struggling with injury, battled round for his 2:24:27.

**Abingdon and Amsterdam Marathons  
** **Sunday 21 October** 

Over the longer full marathon distance, two intrepid Striders faced the 26.2 mile-distance in Abingdon and Amsterdam. Running his fifth marathon, vet **Gavin Jerman** battled chronic calf cramps to run an incredibly even-paced PB time of 3:31:14. Meanwhile, across the channel in Holland, cross-country specialist **Tom Fletcher** ran a really solid 3:19:43 around the iconic Amsterdam course.

Over in the beautiful parkland of Eastnor Castle, four Striders took on the challenging Eastnor 7, a trail run through some of the most beautiful countryside in the region. On the day, **Andrew Paterson **came home first for the club in 10<sup>th </sup>place in a best course time for him of 51:12.

On a surprisingly cold and windy Sunday morning, and only one week after setting his Half Marathon PB in Stroud, **Will Ferguson **finished 17<sup>th </sup>in a highly competitive 10k field, only just outside his 10k PB, in a superb time of 32:21. Next home for the club was the determined **Rachael Cary**, finishing just outside 40 minutes in 40:19.
