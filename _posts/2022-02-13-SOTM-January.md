Congratulations  to Rob Green who is our Strider of the Month for January 2022.

Rob joined us last year and has made a pretty big impact since donning the green & black Striders vest. He's been first finisher for our A Team in the Birmingham League Cross Country in the two races he has competed in so far, finishing 6th overall at Burton Dassett in January on a very tough, hilly course.

Rob also competed in our Staverton 10 mile race (pictured) at the end of January, finishing 2nd on the day in an incredible time of 53:56 to set a new M40-44 Club Record. This is also currently the fastest V40 time for 10miles in the UK in 2022!

Rob is also a regular at Cheltenham Parkrun at Pittville Park and is 1st finisher most of the time he runs, often running around the 17 minute mark for the 5k.

Well done Rob, lots more to come I'm sure and looking forward to seeing a 1st place finish from you at the Cross Country in Redditch
