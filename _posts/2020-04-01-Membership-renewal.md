April has arrived and so it is time to renew your club membership. This year the renewal process is different from previous years so please read the following instructions carefully.

As part of the launch of the new [CLC Striders website](https://clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk) we have updated our privacy statement in relation to GDPR, and issued a new membership form to incorporate this. Because of these changes we are asking all members to complete and sign a new membership form this year.

We are also following the way of the millennials and doing away with cash, cheques, and paper forms. Everything can now be done online via our website and using the secure England Athletics payment system. We highly recommend that everyone renews online since it's convenient (especially for me and the treasurer), quick, secure, and provides automatic EA registration. If, however, you can't, or prefer not to renew online, please get it touch and we'll sort something out.

England Athletics had intended to increase their athlete registration fee for 2020-21 from £15 to £16. However given their [suspension of all athletics activity in England to 31st May](https://clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk/news/2020-03-24-england-athletics-coronavirus-statement-update) they have decided [the 2020-21 fee will be fixed at £15](https://clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk/news/2020-03-26-england-atheltics-membership-statement). With this in mind, the committee has reviewed and agreed the club membership fees for 2020-21 as:

- Full year: £28 (reduced from £29, includes EA registration)
- Half year: £22 (increased from £16, includes EA registration)
- Second claim: £13 (reduced from £14)

After deducting the EA athlete registration and online payment fees, the club receives about £1 per month for all of the membership types. I'm sure you'll agree this is great value.

To renew your membership please do the following:

1. Go the [club's website membership page](https://clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk/membership) and complete the online membership form linked to on that page.
Completion of the form is straightforward. You should choose that you are not a member of another EA club, and select the full year membership, unless you are renewing with CLC as your second claim club. Those people who are renewing as second claim, please provide the name of your first claim club, your URN, and select the second claim membership.
To complete and submit the membership form you will need to read and accept the Club Privacy statement. Your renewal will not be accepted until this is done.

2. Once your application has been processed you will receive an email from England Athletics requesting payment of your membership fees, including a link allowing you to pay securely online using their portal.
Your renewal fee is normally due within 28 days of receiving the EA payment link. However, because of the suspension of all athletic activities until 31st May, EA have extended their deadline for athlete registrations from 30th June to 31st August 2020. In line with this, the club has also extended the membership renewal deadline to 31st August, although prompt payment is preferred if it will not cause hardship.
On receipt of payment your club membership and EA registration is usually activated within a few hours, although there may be some delay if EA's portal is experiencing high renewal request volumes.

If you have any questions please email me at <membership@clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk>.

Thanks
