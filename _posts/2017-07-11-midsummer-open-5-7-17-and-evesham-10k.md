The first Cheltenham Harriers Midsummer Open meeting on Wednesday 5 July saw a good contingent of CLC Striders competing in the Mile race and the 200m.

In the Mile, the first three Striders to compete were Will Fergusson, Sam Baylis and Iain Porter. A fast pace was set and **Fergusson** was pleased to finish inside his target time – in his first outing over this distance this season – with 4:34:1, achieving the club’s highest age grading on the track this season. But performance of the night perhaps came from **Baylis** as next Strider home. Saying he wanted to “put down a marker”, Baylis well and truly threw down the gauntlet, finishing not far behind Fergusson in a scorching time of 4:42:1. **Porter**, just back from cycling Lands End to John O Groats, finished just out side five minutes in 5:03:1.

In the next wave, the Striders were led home by **Chris Driskell**, finishing the mile in a gritty 5:11:1. He was followed home by club ladies captain **Rachel Vines** in a brilliant 5:27:8, a new club record in what is proving to be her strongest track season to date.

In the next wave the ever-competitive **Patricia Sturgess** clocked a superb 5:49.0 and super vet **JJ Willson** finished in 5:52.7, smashing the club’s age category record.

In the final wave, **Amelia Mullins** clocked her first club age category record of the night with a really strong 6:04.7, super vet **Andrew Gage** achieved his fastest mile time in 6:13.8, **Gavin Jerman** registered 6:18.0 and **Emma Abbey** finished well inside the seven-minute mark in a time of 6:42.9.
