Hilary Agate, Laura Kent, Jo Wilkie and Rich Dare represented Gloucestershire at today&#8217;s Inter-Counties at Cofton Park, Birmingham.

In this prestigious event which features the leading athletes in the country, the CLC Striders contingent held their own and put in some impressive performances.

In the 8K senior women&#8217;s race, Hilary Agate ran a strong race to finish in 134th place in a time of 32:22; Laura Kent was next, running well to take 150th place in a time of 32:55 whilst following closely was Jo Wilkie in 206th place in a time of 35:18. The race was won by GB international Gemma Steel.

Rich Dare became only the 3rd man in the history of CLC Striders to run for Gloucestershire in the inter-counties and ran a judiciously-paced race to make a strong debut. On this tough 12K course he finished in 206th place in a time of 41:35. The winner of the men&#8217;s race was Keith Gerrard who added the title to his victory in the England Cross Country Championships two weeks previously.
