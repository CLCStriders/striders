There were biscuits aplenty for the three Sriders who competed in the Pilot Inn Seven Mile race on Thursday evening.

With conditions warm and humid, the trio of Rachel Vines, Amanda Steer and Charles Goodwin set a sensible early pace as they set off on the single lap course around the countryside to the south of Gloucester.

First back for the Striders was Charles Goodwin who produced an impressive sprint finish to take 6th place in a new club record in his category of 45:59. Next back was Rachel Vines who ran well and finished strongly to take the prize for second lady in a time of 50:57. Amanda Steer completed the line-up to take the prize for 3rd lady and set a new club record of 51:20.

The race was won by Severn AC&#8217;s James Rose.</p>
