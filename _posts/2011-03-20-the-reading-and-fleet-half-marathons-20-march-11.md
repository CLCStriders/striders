Reading

Four CLC Striders travelled to Reading to attempt this large city half marathon with a field of 12,500.

Dave Smeath was the first Strider home in 191st place in a below par 1.21.44. Next home was Ian Daniels making a welcome return to racing action in 907th place in an excellent 1.32.37, an agonising 4 seconds off his PB. Naomi Kellett battled valiantly to 1.37.12 despite suffering the effects of a heavy cold, whilst Ian Hill completed the quartet dipping under the 2 hour mark in 1.59.06.

It was an excellent event, embraced by the people of Reading who turned out in numbers to support, and with an exciting finish inside the Madjeski stadium. Definitely one to get a few more Striders involved in next year!

Fleet

Rachael Elkins had a terrific run at the Fleet Half marathon, recording a PB of 1.25.54 in 140th place overall and 14th lady. Adam Cary continued his improvement, coming home in a solid 1.31.02 in 249th position.
