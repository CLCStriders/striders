**The White Horse 5k race 2 0ff 4 18 June 2010** </p> 

**Report**

We had another fantastic turn out for the second White Horse 5k with 24 runners from the Club taking part in this local road race.

The men were led home by John Parker (JP) who was running in his second 5k in 4 days, the Women were led in by Liza Barry who recorded a personal best time for the distance, and led the Ladies Team to Victory.  
Naomi Kellett (LV40), and Phil Jowett (MV40) both set new Club age group records which was an excellent effort by them both.

Well done!
