Both teams finished in a credible 5th place in this highly competitive event.  
The women team was led home by new recruit Vicky Lewis, who finished in an excellent 17th place, she was followed by Alice Johnston in 27th, and Pat Woods 34th. Chantel Lloyd in her first cross country outing ran well to finish in 68th place. Unfortunately Clair Tongue had to retire through injury.

Meanwhile the men's A team were led home by Rich Dare who ran well to finish 8th, Rich Evershed 22nd, Chris Driskell 24th, Dave Smeath 62nd, Jamie Paterson 68th and final A team scorer James Waller in 91st place.  
The men's B team also had good runs from Veteran Charles Goodwin, Joel Freeland, Billy Bradshaw, Tom Thorneycroft, James Gibbs, and Duncan Kay. Damien Cuke pulled out half way due to an ongoing injury.  
With 3 more county fixtures remaining, the Striders have time to close the gap on the other leading clubs.
