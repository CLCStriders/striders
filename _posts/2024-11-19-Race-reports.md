### Midland Ladies Cross-Country League, 2024-2025 Season, Division 1, Race 1
#### Abington Park, Northampton - Hosted by Rugby & Northampton AC
 
Saturday 9 November 2024 saw CLC Striders competing in Race Day ne in their respective regional cross-country leagues – the ladies travelling to Northampton to race in Division One of the Midland League and the men staying at home to race in Pittville Park, Cheltenham in Division Two of the Birmingham and District League. Conditions were near-perfect for cross-country: overcast, still and surprisingly firm underfoot.
 
Due to lots of clashing commitments on the day, the ladies were struggling to muster their mandatary four runners, until Hifsa O’Kelly stepped in, changing her son's birthday party plans to join the team and demonstrating the wonderful spirit of the club in the process. This meant that four CLC Striders ladies made the trip up to Abingdon Park in Northampton to represent the club in their incredibly competitive Division One. 
 
After the long journey, Helen Knight finished in the top 50, in 47th place as the 4th finisher in the Masters category. Liza Bradshaw was next home in 70th overall and 14th Master. Steph Parker was 112th and Hifsa O'Kelly, saving the day, in 133rd. Overall, the ladies were 15th in the team standings but an incredible 3rd in the Masters standings.
