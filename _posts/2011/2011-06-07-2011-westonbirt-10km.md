A squad of 5 CLC ladies travelled to Westonbirt to compete in the 10km race on a beautiful early summer evening. The ever speedy Amanda Steer lead the ladies home in a time of 45.49, 128th place overall. Nikki Smith and Nicola Christian followed in quick succession in 50.12 and 50.19 respectively.

Super Trude ran well to finish in 52.51, 319th place overall. The final strider to complete the course was Rebecca Boulton who demonstrated her improvement by running a massive PB time of 53.01.

Well done ladies!
