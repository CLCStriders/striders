<p>A very well done to John Parker (JP) who has won the Men's County Road Series Championship for 2011! </p>

3 Striders strode out on a beautiful bonfire morning to set off some of their own fireworks&#8230; 

After starting at a blistering pace, completing the first mile in 4.44 pace, JP held on to finish in 3rd place in a very respectable 25.56 . GPS ran a consistent race to finish in a highly commendable 16th position in a time of 29.30 (12 places better than last year!). Dave Mayo came home 3rd in a solid time to finish just outside 41 minutes in 41.03.

An excellent run by the 3 amigos!
