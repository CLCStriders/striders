As the only representative of the Striders Jo Wilkie did the club proud by finishing 1st Senior lady at the Arlingham 4.4m race on Bank Holiday Monday, though beaten by one lady vet into 2nd female overall. The conditions were good and the only female runner ahead of Jo was Bristol & West's Heidi Moulder. After the first mile Jo knew she would have competition for 2nd with Debbie Lee of Tewkesbury so settled in behind her, letting her do the work on the long, seemingly endless straights. Once back into the village with the final loop of less than a mile to go, Jo used her track speed to kick past and pulled out quite a gap to finish 2nd place in a time of 31:30.
