Justine Hale and Liza Barry competed in the 10k Winchcombe Hill Climb on Sunday. The course meanders deceptively round Winchcombe for 2km before heading striaght up Cleeve hill to Belas Knapp then just as directly back down. Justine, a veteran of this tough course, beat her target of an hour to come home in 58.51, while virgin Liza was second woman home in 47.13.

Meanwhile, Chris and Justine Hale, John Parker, and Laura and Lesley Kent all had their mini-Striders out in the kids 1k run. Great to see the stars of the future strutting their stuff!
