excerpt: "<p>The Striders were out in force for the Linda Franks 5 mile road race. John Parker stormed to victory, where he led from the start and pulled away with every stride to win this county series race by over 400 metres. His time was a scintillating 24.49 for this flat very fast course which has yet to be officially certified by the RRC. There were lots of PB's and outstanding performance by all. very well done everyone, Brendan Ward (Club Chairman) Linda Franks Photos Report Results</p>"

**Linda Franks 5-Mile Road Race 23 January 2011**



 </p> 

**Report**

A great friendly atmosphere and well marshalled run, with all the Striders putting in fantastic performances. However, please note that there are a number of errors in the provisional results and the race distance was not certified before the event and is approximately 4.9 miles and not 5miles. As a consequence, I'm sorry that new club records and PB's will not be valid.

Once again, many thanks for all your great efforts and to Tony Stanton for his professional photo work

Brendan
