John Parker battlled Gary Hughes over the windy but scenic course, coming in second in just over 32 minutes - a fantastic time in very blustery conditions. Rachael Elkins continued to show she is a class athlete by leading a victorious women's team home in 39.50. Other strong performances came from Jamie Patterson, Trish Woods and Amanda Steer who all achieved PBs.

A more detailed report will follow once full results are available. Results and official report will also be available from https://www.dursleyac.org.uk/cms/ in due course.</p>
