<p>Seven Striders ran in the Quedgeley 5 Mile Christmas Fun Run on Saturday...</p>

The forecast was not good with weather warnings being issued all week, but despite the cold, the sun was shining meaning the ice disappeared from the roads, making for beautiful crisp winter conditions. The race was hillier than expected, but despite this many PBs were broken and two club records smashed.

1ststrider home was John Howes in 9thposition at 32.29 a PB*, 2ndStrider in 17thplace was Amanda Steer at 34.24 which earnt her the position of 2ndlady and also a PB* and took the club record for LV40, very closely followed by Nick Von Benzon at 34.39 which earnt him 19thposition, a PB and a new V55 club record. 

Next home was another CLC Lady in 21stposition Ange Puffett at 35.45 a PB*, which earnt her 1stLV35. A very promising time for new Strider Robert Bircher in 23rdposition at 36.16 a PB*, another PB beaten by Dave Mayo in 30thposition at 37.58, and the final PB* of the day for Helen Howes who was 38thposition smashing the sub 40mins in a time of 39.39.

(PB* means that the runner had no previous time on an accurately measured 5 mile course)
