The air was damp and cool and the ground extremely sodden and slippy but this didn't hinder the ladies team from scoring well. Liza Barry used her usual strength and determination to lead the ladies for the majority of the race; however, Helen Roberts had the run of her life to stay with Barry on the 2 lap course and managed to pip her close to the finish line, Roberts taking 39th place and Barry claiming 41st place. The final scorer for the women's A team was the ever consistent Trish woods in 53rd place.

Amanda Steer (57th) worked hard and ran well to pull away from team mate Naomi Kellett in the last half a lap. Kellett who has just recently returned to racing and had an excellent run placing 65th. Helen Howes completed the B team in an excellent 95th place.
