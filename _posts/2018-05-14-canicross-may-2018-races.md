Andrew Paterson and his faithful border terrier Betty have been huffing and puffing their way around a couple of events recently.

Over the last two weekends, club member**Andrew Paterson **has competed in two top class canicross events with his dog Betty, finishing 14<sup>th </sup>overall in the Oxford Greenbelt Trail in blistering heat on the 6<sup>th </sup>May in a time of 46:24 (including regular stop-offs for Betty to lap up much needed water). And then the dynamic duo bagged first place in the canicross category and 8<sup>th </sup>overall the Forest of Dean Running Festival 10k (actual distance 10.5k).
