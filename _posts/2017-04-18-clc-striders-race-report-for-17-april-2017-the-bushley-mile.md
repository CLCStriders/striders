On Easter Bank Holiday Monday, two CLC Striders – Paul Lockyer and Clark Lawson – left behind their leftover Easter Eggs and headed over to Bushley Green on the outskirts of Tewksbury for the annual Bushley Mile Road Race.

Taking place on closed country lanes, starting out in the countryside and finishing outside the Bushley Green Cricket Club, the mile-long course is slightly uphill on the first half mile, downhill for the next quarter, before turning right towards the finish line, up the infamous Bushley incline.

The pace was, as expected, brisk and the field quickly spread out. Returning to the course for the fourth time, Paul Lockyer finished in 11<sup>th</sup> place with a time of 5:34. While, in his debut on the route, Clark Lawson finished in 15<sup>th</sup> place recording a maiden mile road race time of 5:50.

Paul later returned to the course to take part in the fun run that was held soon after to support a family member. Clark, meanwhile, decided to cheer the fun runners at the finish with tea and cake provided by the Cricket Club. All in all, a great morning out!
