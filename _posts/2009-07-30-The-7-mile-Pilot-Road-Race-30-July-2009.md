**The Gloucester Festival 7 Mile Pilot Road Race 30 July 2009**

**<a name="Report"><a name="Report"></a>Report</a>**

Seven CLC striders took part in the Gloucester Festival 7M on a breezy but sunny Thursday evening. 

Nathan Jones ran a strong race to come third overall in 40.03, and Wayne wasn?t far behind, finishing fifth in 41.10. &#8220;I think that was my best race performance this year!! Absolutely delighted&#8221;, Nathan Jones

That left Billy and Liza to fight it out for the title of third strider home, with Liza just edging ahead in the last mile. Rob was next to finish, followed by Alexa and finally Louise who secured the team prize for the women. With individual prizes for Nathan, Wayne and Liza and the women?s team prize it was a bit of a Striders biscuit fest! 

Nath, Liza, Rob , Billy and Louise all set new club records and everyone who raced ran a PB for the distance.

Fantastic results, well done everyone
