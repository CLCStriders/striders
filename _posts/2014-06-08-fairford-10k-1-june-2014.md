The one lap course is undulating with a steady climb at 5km, from this point onwards the course is mainly flat with a gentle downhill to the finish in the centre of the village.

Womens captain Rachel Vines led the team of striders from the start, challenged all the way by in form Charlotte Sugden. Vines dug deep to finish 10<sup>th</sup>female overall in a time of 42:27. Hot on her heels was Sugden who ran very strongly finishing 12<sup>th</sup>female in a PB time of 42:59. The ladies team of Brendan Ward coached athletes was completed by Vicky Veness who also had an excellent run despite the heat in 43:58 (15<sup>th</sup>female).

George Parker was the solo male representative, who after a recent illness ran with his girlfriend Helen Mayo in a time of 1:24:53.
