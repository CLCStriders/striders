Will Ferguson put in the performance of his life at the Aztec 5k in Bristol on 26 May 2015.

Cheltenham's Graham Rush broke away early on in the race with Ferguson staying with the chasing pack of five. He kicked on on the last kilometre to record a sub 3 minute last K to break clear and finish in second place smashing his PB by 17 seconds and setting a CLC Striders club record. Ferguson stopped the clock at an excellent 15.07. This was a big break through for Ferguson and puts him up to another level in competitive terms.

Meanwhile JJ Willson, an M55, vet had a storming run setting a new club age group record with a time of 19.23. Dan Harte followed Willson in a solid 21.53 with M65 David James setting a club M65 age group record in a time of 22.34.
