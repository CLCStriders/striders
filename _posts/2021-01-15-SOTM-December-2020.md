Congratulations to John Willson who is our Strider of the Month for December 2020.

JJ, despite the pandemic, had a strong year of running in 2020, coming back from injury and hitting some fine form.

In December, JJ had an excellent run at the Castle Combe 10k finishing in a time of 41.20 for a new age category Club Record! He also ran well at the very muddy Westonbirt Christmas 10k, finishing 1st V60 on the day. 

To cap off a brilliant month, JJ also won the club Festive 5k Competition, posting a fantastic time of 20.08 and age graded score of 82%, doing so wearing a Reindeer jumper with lights and a Santa Hat...superb.

Well done JJ, keep it up
