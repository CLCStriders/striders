#### Valencia Marathon - Sunday 7 December 
 
In the sunshine of southern Spain, club Captain Adam Greenwood ran a great marathon in the warm conditions to register a 6-minute PB in a time of 3:09:39. An absolutely incredible effort by Adam and testament to the huge amount of training and preparation he put into the race.
