A group of three CLC Striders made the trip to Bristol Aztec West on Tuesday night to compete in the Aztec West Fast 5km race, the first one of a series of 4.

Men’s captain Joel Freeland led the Striders home in the 3-lap fast road race under very windy conditions in a time of 19:52. Next was Karlien Heyrman, women’s vice-captain, pushed on by Joel to finish as third senior lady in 20:01. Andrew Gage finished in an excellent time of 23:09
