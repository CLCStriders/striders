On Sunday I did the Winchcombe Hill climb &#8211; a 10km run and a real lung buster!!! It started in the grounds of Sudeley castle and made its way mainly off road up to the famous burial mound of Belas Knap. No time to take in the beautiful views before descending rapidly back to Sudeley. Again I was the only Strider representative which is a real shame as it is a fun and challenging course. All very well organised too. I came 1st lady (by 8 minutes) and 10th overall in a time of 45.28.  
William and Oliver did the 1 km fun run which was brilliant for kids, with medals and sweets to all finishers, so come on Striders, bring the whole family next year!</p>
