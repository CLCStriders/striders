The Striders contingent in the Mile event was spread over three heats, with seven of the team making their debut at the distance on the track. In the first heat youngster Ollie Moseley showed the value of his recent hard work in training by breaking the six minute barrier to finish in 5:54.4 ahead of George Parker in 6:03.5 and the constantly improving Steph Parker in 6:15.3. In the final heat, Jon Howes made a strong start and held on well to finish in 5:12.3 just ahead of chasing Striders Jon Cooke and Joel Freeland.

In the 10,000m Nick Barry ran a fantastic race in a time of 32:59 to lead the Striders charge and narrowly missed out on the win with Harry Bishop of Severn AC showing an impressive kick in the final 100m to take the victory. Will Ferguson ran a gutsy race having made the front running in the early stages to finish in 33:56. Juan Moreno, Iain Porter and James Oram all ran strongly to duck under 37 minutes. Rachael Cary made an impressive return to racing with a time of 40:16
