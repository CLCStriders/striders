You may recall that the membership year runs from 1 April to 31 March. I will renew your membership with England Athletics when we receive your subscription money. 

It was agreed at our last AGM that the subs for this year will be Â£15.

Please send your payment to Clive Hodges or give it to Paul Jenkins, our Treasurer.
