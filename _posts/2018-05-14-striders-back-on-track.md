After a long, cold, snowy winter of cross country and road competition, May has seen a welcome return to the track for CLC athletes.

**Brewer Games  
** **Prince of Wales Stadium, Cheltenham, Monday May 7th**

On a scorching sunny day, a crop of Striders entered a variety events at the start of the track and field season.

**Paul Lockyer **clocked a club age category-equalling 13.0 seconds dead in the 100m, with **Nicola Weager **registering 15.1 seconds. **Paul  Lockyer** also raced the 400m, in a strong time of 62.1 seconds.

**Gareth Harries **enjoyed a club record-breaking day in his V45 category with 28.5 seconds for the 200m and 2:27.2 for the 800m.

Over the longer distances, **Clark Lawson **maintained his very fine form this year by finishing well under his five-minute target time for the 1,500m in 4:52.8
. While, in the 3,000m, **Joel Freeland **smashed his PB with a time of 10:45.4, with **Helen Knight **clocking 11:59.1, **Amelia Mullins **12:30.0 and **Nicola Weager **13:54.9
.

**County Athletics Championships  
** **Blackbridge, Gloucester, Saturday 12 and Sunday 13 May**

The annual County Track Championships at the Blackbridge track in Gloucester saw a few Striders enter the fray.

Performance of the meet from a CLC athlete came from **Will Ferguson **who led out a quality field in the 5,000m, gradually shedding runners with each lap until just one athlete, Ben Robinson from the Bristol and West, club was left with him. Ferguson continued to drive hard but the B&W athlete kicked hard in the final lap to take gold with the brave Ferguson finishing in silver medal position in a time of 15.42.

**Nicola Weager **won double gold in the 3,000m, in a PB time of 13.28, and in the long jump, where she jumped a PB distance of 4.17m.

Veterans **Paul Lockyer **and **Gareth Harries **competed over shorter distances with Paul Lockyer registering a time of 2:27:2 in the 800m, Gareth clocking 63 seconds in the 400m and then both racing over 100m – with Paul coming home in 13.3 seconds and Gareth bagging a new club record age category time of 14.2 seconds.
