On a grey but unseasonably mild first day of December, the CLC ladies and men’s teams found themselves competing over the same course in their respective Midland Cross Country Divisions. The rolling parkland of Clopton Park on the outskirts of Stratford makes for some of the best cross country terrain around, and it was to prove a day on which club athletes proved themselves again.

In the men’s race in Division 2, the club registered one of its best performances for a long time, with four runners in the top 50 and all six of its A-team scorers well inside the top 100.
