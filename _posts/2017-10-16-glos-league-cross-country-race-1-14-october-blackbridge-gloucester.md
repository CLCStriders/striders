In the first cross-country fixture of the season, CLC Striders turned out en masse to represent their club. In breezy and balmy conditions, the women and men did well in their first test away from the road and track for some months. Club teams were gathered from all over the region to take part and the fields were sizable and featured some quality athletes.

In the senior ladies race **Karlien Heyrman** – beginning to return to her best – brought the Striders home with a 25<sup>th</sup> place finish and a time of 25:19.

**Who&#8217;s the Daddy?**

Meanwhile, in the men’s race, just one week after becoming a father for the first time, **Will Ferguson** stormed home to a convincing win in a time of 28:39 across the 5.5-mile course.

He was followed home by **Tom Kabala** in 56<sup>th</sup> in 33.18 making a great debut appearance for the club across the country, with **Mark Fuller**, also making his cross-country Striders debut, close behind in 58<sup>th</sup> position in a time of 33.21. The ever-reliable **Charles Goodwin** finished in 62<sup>nd</sup> place as the fourth MV50 in a time of 33.31, with **Tom Vickers** and **Paul Northup** making up the A team scorers finishing virtually neck-and-neck in 72 and 73 place respectively, in 34:11 and 34:12.

Next home was a recovering **Will Pearce** in 83rd in a time of 34:30 and then **Neil Broadbent** in 103rd in 35:15 and vet **JJ Willson** in 111<sup>th</sup> in 35:35 (as the 5<sup>th</sup> finisher in the MV55 category). **Chris Driskell** posted a steady season opener, finishing in 113<sup>th</sup> place in 35:36 and **Paul Lockyer** was 114<sup>th</sup> in 35:39. The sixth finisher for the B Team, in 130<sup>th</sup> place, was **Alex Monro** in a time of 36:28.

The other racers and finishers for CLC men on the day were **Gareth Harries**, 134<sup>th</sup> in 36:43, **James Gibbs**, 146<sup>th</sup> in 37:43, **Andrew Paterson**, 149<sup>th</sup> in 38:03, **Stuart Barr**, 152<sup>nd</sup> in 38:15, **Bradley Coates**, 171<sup>st</sup> in 39:54, **Martin Bick** 187<sup>th</sup> in 42:33, **Christopher Thomas** in 197<sup>th</sup> in 43:56, and **Robert Gladwin**, 198<sup>th</sup> in 44:03.

In the Open Team competition, Striders men finished 4th with their A Team, 14<sup>th</sup> with their B Team and 19<sup>th</sup> with their C Team. It was particularly encouraging to note the strong showing of cross country debutants Tom Kabala and Mark Fuller as this, coupled with other runners yet to return who were unavailable on the day, augers well for a good season to come. In the Masters competition, Striders men finished in 7<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> positions.

Running separately, **David James** bagged a strong second place in his MV65 age category in a time of 29:17 over the shorter course.
