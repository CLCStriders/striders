CLC Striders were saddenedÂ to hear that former member, Ben Pedley, had passed away last week.

As well as being a likeable and friendly guy, Ben was also a very good runner. Ben ran for the club during 2010 achieving a 10km PB of 35:23 at the Easter 10km at the White Horse in Gloucester and a 1500m PB of 4:23.1 at the County Track and Field Championships. Ben was also selected to run for the county at the Inter-Counties Cross Country Championships and came 123rd in the under 20 men's race.

In more recent years, Ben ran socially with the club as he had found his true passion of cycling. He had also moved to Reading where he was studying Chemistry at the University of Reading.

On Monday 20th March, Ben was out cycling when he collided with a pedestrian who had stepped out into the road. Ben suffered serious head injuries and was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Unfortunately, Ben later died on the morning of Wednesday 22nd March.

Ben was 26 years old and although we hadn't seen him around in recent months, he will be greatly missed.

Ben's funeral will be held on Monday 24rd April at 12pm at St. Peter's Church, Church Road, Leckhampton for anyone who would like to attend.

Rest in Peace Benjamin Fredrick Pedley 30 January 1991 &#8211; 22 March 2017
