**The Magnificent 7 Promoted By Ledbury Harriers 18 April 2010** 

**Report**

John Parker (JP) made it Four Wins out of Four at Ledbury Harriers Magnificent 7 Mile Multi Terrain Race. JP led from start to finish and completely obliterated the field winning by a staggering 1 minute 37 seconds from Gloucester's Steve Milward. Parkers time for the very tough and hilly multi terrain course was 41.02 which smashed the previous course record by 42 seconds which was held by Dursleys Gary Hughes.  
James gibbs also ran for the Striders and proved he is returning to form, Gibbs ran an excellent race to finish 26th in a time of 51.41.

Well done to you both.  
Brendan
