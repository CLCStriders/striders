Liza had her best ever performance in the Midland League Cross Country at Leamington, showing enormous grit and determination to finish 41st on what was a very testing course to say the least! She also perfomed strongly at Pittville with a 17th place finish.  
The Strider of the Month is primarily about Striders of whatever standard performing to the best of their ability &#8230;but it is also worth noting that Liza showed great commitment to the club in driving back from a wedding in Manchester at 3 in the morning in order to be a marshall at the Runway 10k.  
Well done Liza!
