There were strong performances from the four Striders who turned out to represent their club at the Brewer Games at the Prince of Wales Stadium.

In the rarely run 1000m, Pat Woods, Rachel Vines and Duncan Kay lined up for the club, and it was Pat Woods who set the pace ne her track debut to finish in a time of 03:25. She was closely followed by Rachel Vines who finished in 03:35, whilst Duncan Kay broke the all-important 4-minute mark to finish in 03:59. The race was won by Harriers'junior Luke Carroll in a brisk 02:30.

With Kay opting to rest for the 1500m, the Striders'men were represented by Rich Cannock making a welcome return from injury. The men were first off and against a strong field, Cannock held his own and went well below the 5-minute mark to finish in 04:50. In the women's race, Pat Woods once again set a strong pace to finish in 05:23 whilst Vines ran a well-paced race to finish in 05:41.</p>
