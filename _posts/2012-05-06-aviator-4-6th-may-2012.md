In unusually dry and calm conditions, Parker led the race from the outset and never looked in any danger as he beat his time from 2011 by nearly 15 seconds.

In the race for second place, it was Anthony Bailey of Almost Athletes who set the early pace but he was followed closely by Stridersâ€™ own Rich Dare, who, on his way to an excellent time of 21:52, passed Bailey around the 3-mile mark. Bailey comfortably held onto third place to finish in 22:13. 

In the womenâ€™s race the honours went to Michelle Carroll of Almost Athletes, who finished first senior lady; Lucy McNulty who finished second, and Fran Osborne who finished third. Lucyâ€™s time was a new club record in her category.

Other particularly notable performances from the Striders came from Jon Bird who finished fifth; Amanda Steer who took the LV35-44 prize; Charlotte Oâ€™Brien who claimed the U20L prize and Derek Tebbs who broke the club record in his category.
