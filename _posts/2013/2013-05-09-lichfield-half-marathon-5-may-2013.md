The day started off very cold In Lichfield but by the time the half marathon started the sun had burnt through and made for a very warm run. The race was an undulating course through some very picturesque villages. It was perfectly organized and well marshaled with all the roads traffic free. The first race back after an injury gave Martin a very happy finishing time of 1:38:46 finishing 146th out of 1107.
