Rich Cannock, Duncan Kay and Claire Sansome all did the club proud. After dogged training through a cold autumn and winter it was, perhaps, inevitable that race day would be baking hot, with temperatures nudging 20 degrees on the Isle of Dogs. Official finishing times were:

Rich Cannock - 3.08:37

Claire Sansome - 4.43:21

Duncan Kay - 5.45:45
