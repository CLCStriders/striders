The almost 10 mile course starts on road and climbs steeply for just over a mile until you reach the woods which include part of the Cotswold way. Although the sun was out the woods created enough shade to make cool conditions. The competitors ran two laps of the undulating woods, Vines in constant fear of being lapped by her club colleague. Luckily that didn't happen and the pair ran well. Driskell finishing in 5thplace in a time of 1:03:44 and Vines in 62ndposition overall (12thfemale) in a time of 1:20:42
