Out of the six there was one stand-out performance and that came from relative newcomer Andrew Jones. Jones went off with the lead group and maintained a strong pace to finish in 6th place in a time of 29:17.

This was a great performance and shows great promise for the rest of the cross country season and beyond.

Chris Driskell was next just managing to beat the 30 minute mark in 29:55 and he was followed by Pat Woods who came 51st in 34:19 and Dave Mayo who finished 53rd in 34:41.

Andrew Paterson ran well to finish inside the top half in 83rd place with a time of 37:27 whilst Beckie Boulton completed the line-up in 122nd place in a time of 40:40.</p>
