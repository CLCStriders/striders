A very dry but chilly start in the Cotswolds preceded a super 10 mile, predominantly off-road, run through some glorious countryside. The second half of the race includes a small river crossing, a steep climb and some tree roots just to keep you on your toes.

Helen Roberts soared to victory as the SF 1st place winner in 1:14:14. Rob Bircher achieved a PB with Natalie and Ross Greening and Jo Bryant completing the contingent. Everyone concluded that it was a great event, well organised and a fab way to spend a Sunday morning. Highly recommended!
