A CLC Striders team ravaged by injury and illness travelled to Wyken Croft Park in Coventry for the 3rd of this season's 4 Birmingham Cross Country League fixtures.
  
The Striders, who are trying to consolidate their position in Division 2 after last year's successful promotion lost at least 3 of their expected top 6 scorers on the eve of the race, but those who did run showed a great deal of determination and commitment. Men's captain Chris Driskell, who was himself ailing from a chest infection, still managed to lead the team home in a highly respectable 42nd place. Dave Smeath, enjoying the 'good to firm' conditions under foot after enduring numerous races through quagmires in recent times, showed a return to perform with a gritty 77th place, whilst Damien Cuke was chased all the way around by Jon Howes to both finish in the low hundreds. JJ Willson made his first scoring contribution for the club with a gutsy 140th place, and Phil Jowett removed his coaching tracksuit and dusted off his spikes to complete the scoring six in 147th place. Andrew Patterson and Duncan Kaye also ran with typical determination to complete the Brendan Ward trained octet.

The team are now in 12th position in the division, and will need a strong showing in the final fixture to keep the spectre of relegation at bay. The final race is in the familiar environs of Pittville Park on 9th February.
