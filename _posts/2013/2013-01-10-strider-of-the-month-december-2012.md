Trish is a very committed member of the club, and a a very consistent performer, regularly scoring for the ladies team in both Glos League and Midlands League cross country races. She also bagged a trophy by being second lady (behind Liza) in the Rudolph's Rampage in Painswick before Xmas, whilst wearing a santa hat!

Well done Trish!
