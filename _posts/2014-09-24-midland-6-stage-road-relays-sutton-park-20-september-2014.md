Will Ferguson anchored the CLC Striders mens team in a great performance. Nick Barry set a strong pace in the first leg to show that the Striders men meant business, Mark Langman and Juan Moreno put in some strong performances in the second and third legs respectively legs before Iain Porter had a cracking run in the fourth leg to make up 6 places and put the Striders in a strong position going into the closing stages. Iain handed over to James Oram who picked up another place before setting Will Ferguson on his way in the sixth and final leg, Will pulled off the performance of the day to make up 7 places and finish in a fantastic 19:12, battling hard with a fast finishing competitor on the long uphill finishing straight. The &#8216;A&#8217;team&#8217;s average pace throughout the race was an impressive 5:40 minutes per mile  
The Men&#8217;s &#8216;B&#8217;team did not drop a single place after the first leg and there was a superb performance from Jon Howes who took almost 2 minutes off of his PB over this testing course to finish in 21:59. Martin Brown and Gordon Bendall also impressed on their road relay debuts  
In the Women&#8217;s race a fast finishing Jo Wilkie capped off an excellent performance from the ladies &#8216;A&#8217;team as they finished in 17th place overall out of 79 teams. Sutton Park veteran Rachel Vines ran a fantastic first leg, clocking her fastest ever time over the 4.315km distance, Karlien Heyrman and Charlotte Sugden both ran well in their first road relay outing to set up Jo Wilkie for the final leg in which she made up 5 places and finished in a course PB of 16:39. The women&#8217;s &#8216;B&#8217;team of Amelia Mullins, Steph Parker, Rachel Burdick and Becky Boulton demonstrated the strength in depth of the Striders ladies with a 37th place finish.
