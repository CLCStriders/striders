Helen and Jon Howes took part in the Lewes 10K on Easter Monday &#8211; further evidence that you can&#8217;t leave your race addiction at home when you&#8217;re supposed to be on holiday! Jon completed the multi-terrain course through the beautiful, if wet, Sussex countryside in 41:23 &#8211; good enough for 32nd place, whilst Helen managed 52:00 and 222nd (39th lady) in the 480-strong field. A great race if you&#8217;re ever down that way!
