What a fantastic time was had by all at the white horse 5k road race which celebrated the Striders 3rd year as a competitive club.32 runners competed for the Striders at this County Championship event. 

John Parker (JP) flew round the White horse course and led the striders home to take county silver in a new club record time of 15.11, this took 12 seconds of JP's existing club record. Only six seconds separated the first three runners with Cheltenhams Dave Roper taking the Gold medal in a splendid 15.08. The next five striders to follow Parker all finished within 21 seconds of each other, John Bird put in a fantastic effort to record 17.39, on his heels was Chris Driskell who ran well in 17.41, Wayne Usher 17.44, Dave Smeath in an excellent 17.45, and final scorer Chris GPS Hale in 18 minutes flat. This was superb packing by the men's team. Other notable performances from the men came from Charles Goodwin (The General) who set a new MV45 Club Record, and Derek Tebbs who set a Club Record in the MV 50 age group.

The Women's team did the Club Proud taking the team prize and were led home by Hilary Agate who won County Gold with an excellent 18.33, Liza Doc Barry was next home and did well to take County Silver, final team scorer was Rachel DJ Vines who ran an encouraging 20.15 on her comeback race. Other notable performances from the women's team came from the ever improving Amanda Steer who ran 20.50, and took County Silver in the LV 40 age group, Sophie Jones ran well to record 20.56, with Sian Holly who is also on the comeback trail running 21.02.

Finally I would like to sincerely thank all you athletes for competing for the club, Thanks to Tony stanton who took photos, Penny Ferguson for providing her legendary flapjacks, Men's Club Captain Rich Dare Devil Dare for his support, Laura Kent (LK) for leading the athletes round on her bike, and Mike Simpson for all his encouragement. I do apologise if I have missed anyone out.

Happy running.

Take care.
