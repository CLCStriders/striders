Arriving at Swindon for her Park Run debut, it was blowing a gale, so any hopes of a PB for Jo went out of the window straightaway. The warm up confirmed this as the course, although not hilly, could not be described as flat either! 

However, despite finishing in 21:04, a time well below current form, Jo was first lady home and 17<sup>th</sup>overall out of 228 competitors, so pleased with her result given the conditions. The hardest part for Jo was carrying on afterwards to ensure the required mileage for the day was covered in the build-up towards the Paris marathon in April.
