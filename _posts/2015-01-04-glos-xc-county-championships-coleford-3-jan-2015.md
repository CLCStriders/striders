Saturday 3rdJanuary was the day of the Gloucestershire cross country championships in Coleford in the Forest of Dean. The CLC Striders dominated in the womens race and were placed first and second team on the day. They were also the first Masters team on the day too.  
The course consisted of two laps, partly on a playing field but the bulk of the loop was around a wooded area which was challenging especially given the fog and mud! In form Jo Wilkie lead the team home in 3rdplace overall and first LV35. Liza Barry continued her string of strong performances by finishing in 5thplace. Barry was followed by the trio of Rachel Vines (6th), Katie Truslove (7th) and Karlien Heyrman (8th) who ran together throughout the race and finished in quick succession. Next home and demonstrating a very strong performance was Amanda Steer in 10thplace, followed by the ever improving Rebecca Bolton in 12thplace. Boulton completed the B team and the Masters team. Rachel Burdick followed in 13thplace in a strong run. Emma Abbey ran well to finish in 18thplace.  
CLC striders had 3 men competing in the championships. In a recent return to racing Chris Driskell ran well to finish 27thoverall. Neil Broadbent (38th) and David James (65th) also had good runs.
