As the tail-end of Storm Eric blew through, CLC athletes made their last trips away this winter season to compete in the tough Birmingham Cross Country League.** **

The ladies travelled south to Cattle Country to a Division One race hosted by Gloucester AC and made even more challenging by last-minute changes to the course in order to avoid the overnight flooding experienced in the south of the county.<figure id="attachment_3320" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3320" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Across a very muddy course, the ladies were led home by the consistently strong **Helen Knight**, in 60<sup>th </sup>place overall as the 14<sup>th </sup>master in a time of 35:44. She was followed by **Rachel Vines **who has made incredible strides across the season, finishing in 67<sup>th </sup>overall as the 18<sup>th </sup>master in 36:19. Road specialist **Rachael Cary **came 72<sup>nd </sup>overall and 20<sup>th </sup>master in 36:40 and **Amelia Mullins **bagged 75<sup>th </sup>spot and 22<sup>nd </sup>master in 36:57.

**Amanda Steer **finished in 77<sup>th </sup>overall as the 24<sup>th </sup>master, **Laura Fletcher **was 105<sup>th </sup>overall, **Sophie Longmore **was 106<sup>th</sup>, **Cerys Jones **was 115<sup>th </sup>and 44<sup>th </sup>master, **Nicola Weager **was 116<sup>th </sup>and **Becky Reynolds **was 119<sup>th </sup>and 47<sup>th </sup>master finisher.

Overall the ladies finished 12<sup>th </sup>overall in the league across the season, meaning they avoided relegation from what is an incredibly tough and competitive Division One. While the Masters finished in a brilliant 5<sup>th </sup>place.

The men travelled the furthest north they’ve been to compete in Division Two across a course in Park Hall Country Park near Stoke on Trent, in a race hosted by Trentham RC.<figure id="attachment_3321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3321" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Once again, the men’s top six scorers all finished within the top 100 places, no mean feat in the Midland League. They were led home by **Will Ferguson **in 6<sup>th </sup>place and a time of 37:46. Will also bagged himself an amazing 3<sup>rd </sup>position overall in the individual league placings, despite only being able to compete in 3 out of the 4 fixtures.

Next home was the stand-out club cross country performer of the season, **Tom Kabala**, who once again secured a top-20 finish in 18<sup>th </sup>place and a time of 38:45. Tom finished in 19<sup>th </sup>position overall across the four fixtures – a great achievement. **Iain – ‘Mountain Goat’ – Porter**, came in 39<sup>th </sup>in a time of 39:55 and **Louis Fievet **finished in 63<sup>rd </sup>in a time of 41:37. The remaining first team scorers were **Tom Fletcher **in 78<sup>th </sup>place and a time of 42:25 and **Will Pearce, **just behind in 81<sup>st </sup>place and a time of 42:37.

**Max Baylis **finished in 117<sup>th</sup>, **Eoin McQuone **in 126th, **Andrew Gage **in 171<sup>st</sup>, **Tim Brock **in 173<sup>rd</sup>, **Mike Speke **in 185<sup>th </sup>and **Chris Thomas **in 190<sup>th</sup>.
