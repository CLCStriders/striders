On a cold and grey Saturday afternoon, CLC Striders Ladies and Men’s teams made the journey north to compete in the third race of the Midland League Two Cross Country Competition for this season. Held in the beautiful, rolling grounds of Cofton Park in the south-west of Birmingham, the race saw the ladies race over two full laps of the park and the men over three.

Once again, the Striders ladies turned in some great performances, even without some of their stalwart runners. Finishing in 20<sup>th</sup> place overall and as the 8<sup>th</sup> senior lady, **Karlien Heyrman** continued to shine, bringing the team home in a very fast 28:30. Hot on her heels **Helen Knight** finished 25<sup>th</sup> overall as the 13<sup>th</sup> in the Masters category in 28:41. Next home were the two vets **Amanda Steer** and **Amelia Mullins**, finishing in 38<sup>th</sup> and 43<sup>rd</sup> overall as the 19<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> in the Masters in strong times of 30:20 and 30:47 respectively.

**Laura Fletcher** finished 55<sup>th</sup> overall as the 20<sup>th</sup> senior lady in 32:22 and **Nicola Weager** was 60<sup>th</sup> overall and 22<sup>nd</sup> senior in 32:37. Last for the club on the day, but not least, **Cerys Jones** put in another solid performance in her first season with the club finishing in 101<sup>st</sup> overall and 63<sup>rd</sup> in the Masters category in a time of 36:06.  
On the day the ladies seniors team was 5<sup>th</sup> and the masters finished in 4<sup>th</sup>, meaning that CLC ladies are now lying in 3rd place overall in the league, with the masters in 4th overall – meaning there is everything to pay for in the final race of the season.

After cheering on their team-mates, it was then the turn of the men, who had turned out in great numbers, with almost three complete teams on the day.
