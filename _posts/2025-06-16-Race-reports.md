#### Cirencester Sizzler 10k - Wednesday 11 June 2025

On a warm and sunny midsummer evening half a dozen CLC Striders headed to Cirencester Park to test themselves over the 10K distance in an event hosted by Cirencester AC.

Over a challenging and undulating course Pete Duffy was the first Strider home in 35:39, finishing 8th overall and second MV35. Completing the male contingent, Jonathan Margetts clocked 39:48, Oliver Wright-Jones 39:59 and Tim Brock 42:07 (also finishing second in the MV55 category).

For the women, Helen Knight romped home in 41:06 and was first in her FV45 category, with Ellie Pudifoot the only other female Strider, completing the course in 42:09.

#### Black Mountains Ultra - Sunday 15 June 2025

Meanwhile, over in the Welsh Black Mountains CLC Strider Rich Elsworthy well-and-truly laid his UTMB Ultra-Trail Snowdonia DNF to bed by storming the 50-mile course (plus 11,000 feet of elevation!) and setting a new event record of just 8 hours and 32 minutes. Two other intrepid Striders also completed the 50-mile course, Josh in 11:42:20 and Tom Fletcher 11:56:22.

#### Endure 24, Reading - Saturday / Sunday 7 & 8 June 2025

At a very wet Endure 24, Striders Kate Telford and Gary Farquharson ran as part of a tag-team of four to complete as many five-mile laps as possible from midday Saturday to midday Sunday. Kate completed eight laps and Gary six.
