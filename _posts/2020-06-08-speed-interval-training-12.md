Here is a nice treat for you all to do this week as your main interval speed session. 

Warm up 1 mile jog - mobility and dynamic stretches. 

**Session** 
* 4 x 2 mins @3k pace - 90 secs jog recovery between efforts (3 mins jog recovery after the set) 
* 4 x 1 min @1mile pace - 90 secs jog recovery between efforts (3 mins jog recovery after the set) 
* 10mins @10mile pace - (5 mins jog recovery after the set) 
* 4 x 1min @1mile pace - 90 secs jog recovery between efforts (3 mins jog recovery after the set)
* 4 x 30secs @800m pace - 60 secs jog recovery between efforts. 
* 1 mile cool down easy recovery. 
Total = 28 mins  of effort.

This is a specific 5k session and must be run relaxed and in control. Itâ€™s a tough session and requires the right mindset and focus throughout. 

Do your stretches at the end of the session.

Enjoy. Coach B
