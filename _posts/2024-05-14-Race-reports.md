### The Bourton Mile and County Champs - Friday 10 May 2024
 
One of the most popular local evening races in the calendar, the Bourton Mile never fails to draw a great field. This year it included running royalty, as former 5,000m world record holder and all-round middle-distance legend and nice guy Dave Moorcroft turned up to take part and then award the prizes at the end.
 
The evening was warm and still; perfect conditions for the mile dash back into Bourton village centre from the Rissington Road. Once again, CLC Striders athletes excelled, doing themselves and their club proud.
 
First to finish for the club was the indomitable Rob Green, securing 4th place overall, 1st MV40 in a PB of just 4:29. Rob also smashed a long-standing club record and earned gold in his MV40 category in the County Champs. Max Harrison-Tosatto was next home in 11th place overall and a PB time of 4:41. Not far behind was the 3rd CLC Strider to finish, Alex Johnston, in a time of 4:45, meaning that the club had three finishers in the top 20 of what was a very fast and competitive field – an amazing achievement. 
 
Joel Freeland ran the mile of his life to bag a new PB time of 5:08 and Nick Ledwold also ran a PB time of 5:25. Continuing the PB theme, Kate Telford and Aled Leaver both clocked  PB times of 5:31, with Kate also winning gold in her age category in the County Champs. Gary Farquharson and Paul Northup crossed the finishing line in lockstep, in chip times of 5:42 and 5:41 respectively, with Gary edging the photo finish to earn bronze in the VM55 County Champs.
 
Next came a crop of Striders all registering 6-minute-something times: Matt Ashman in 6:05, the fast-improving Colin Upton in a PB time of 6:11, Mike Speke in 6:23, Julia Rose in a PB of 6:42, and, last but not least, an amazing run from David James, earning 1st place in the VM70 category, gold in the County Champs and registering a nationally creditable time for his vet category of just 6:49.
 
Meanwhile, at the other end of the running spectrum, three CLC Striders were competing in two of the UK’s most iconic trail ultras – on what was the hottest weekend of the year so far. 
 
### UTMB Snowdon Ultra 100k Trail Marathon - 10th May 2024
 
In the Snowdonia 100k Trail Ultra, Rich Elsworthy and Ollie Watkins took on one of the most gruelling all-terrain trail ultras there is, through the beautiful but challenging Snowdonia National Park.
 
Running for the best part of a whole day and evening, Rich Elsworthy raced incredibly well to secure 26th place overall in a time of 18:21:07 – an amazing achievement. Ollie Watkins was seeking redemption, after having to retire from the event in 2023, and battled early issues to come through strongly and finish in a time of 21:56:10. 
 
### The Lap  75K Trail Ultra, clockwise around Lake Windemere - May 11th 2024

Helen Knight returned to this iconic challenge – where runners and walkers have 24 hours to circumnavigate England’s largest lake, Lake Windermere. This year, Helen was equal 2nd lady and equal 13th overall in a time of 9:38:09. Running in the company of another lady competitor for more than half of the course, Helen decided to cross the line together with her, 10 minutes slower than her time last Spring, but feeling way more comfortable.
 
### Sherborne Five-mile trail - Sunday 12 May 2024
 
Up in the beautiful National Trust parkland at Sherborne, four CLC Striders took part in the friendly Sherborne Five-Mile trail event. Fiona Brady Miller was the first Strider home in 24th place overall as 2nd LV40 in a time of 37:10. Hot on her heels was Luke Hunter in 25th place and a time of 37:15. Amelia Mullins was 38th overall and 2nd LV50 in a time of 39:44 and Nicola Weager was 67th in a time of 44:23.
 
### The Scorpion Run, Symonds Yat Rock, Forest of Dean - 12th May 2024

Laura McEvoy ran this local race with a sting in its tail. Winding its way around the forest’s fire tracks for 10k or so, the last 1k is a serious climb back up to the finish. Laura enjoyed the event and clocked 1:07:01.
