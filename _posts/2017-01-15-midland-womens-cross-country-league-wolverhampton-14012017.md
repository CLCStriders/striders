Five CLC Striders traveled to Wolverhampton to compete in the 3rd of the 4 Midlands Womens' Cross Country League fixtures. The weather was pretty dreary but the ladies took this in their stride and ran well to finish 11th team overall on the day and 10th Masters team. First home for the club was Rachel Vines who came in in 14th place. Vines was followed by Amelia Mullins who ran well to finish in 42nd place. Rebecca Reynolds put in a bold effort to come 82nd and Emma Abbey completed the A team in 108th place. Amy Underdown who continues to improve race on race completed the squad finishing in 120th place.
