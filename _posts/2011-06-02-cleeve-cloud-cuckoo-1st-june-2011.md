CLC Striders had a brilliant night on Cleeve common, as 12 of them took on the tough, hilly off-road 5.5M course. John Parker smashed the course record, winning the race in 31.16, over 3 and a half minutes ahead of his nearest competitor. Chris Driskell and Dave Smeath, who finished 7th and 14th respectively, completed CLC Striders winning men's team. The women's race was much closer, with Rachael Elkins and Liza Barry battling Lucy Walmsley from Bourton throughout the race, with only 18 seconds separating the three of them by the finish. Rachael finished 2nd and Liza 3rd, and Trish Woods completed the victorious women's team and making it a double victory for CLC. Other notable performances came from Dave Billingham, who returned to racing after a year out, Jo Wilkie who finished in 44.13 and Amelia Mullins who clocked 48.27 - good training for the Cotswold Relay in a few weeks!
