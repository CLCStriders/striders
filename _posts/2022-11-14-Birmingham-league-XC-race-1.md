On an unseasonably mild mid-November morning it was time for CLC Striders to return to their respective regional cross country racing, with the ladies travelling to Park Hall Country Park, Stoke, in a Midland League Division 2 fixture hosted by Trentham RC, while the men stayed closer to home to run at Plock Court in Gloucester in their Birmingham League Division 2 fixture, hosted by Severn AC.

First, the ladies, who were running four miles among the woodland, heath and lakes of Stoke’s national nature reserve at Park Hall Country Park the rolling hills of Park Hall Country Park, where Helen Knight continued her phenomenal form to finish in third place overall and as 1st in the Masters category in a blistering time of 26:59. Next home was ladies captain Rachel Vines, getting stronger with each race, and finishing in 17th overall as 6th in the Masters category in a time of 29:09. Amelia Mullins was 38th overall and 18th in the Masters and Helen Howes was 58th overall and 31st in the Masters. The ladies fought hard to achieve 7th place in the overall team competition on the day, and were 2nd in the Masters team competition.

Meanwhile, the mens team were at Plock Court in Gloucester where, even with all the recent rain, there was only one short section of wet and boggy ground to navigate in what was otherwise a firm, flat and fast course. The men turned out three full teams.

First home for the A team was the ever-reliable Rob Green in 10th place overall and as 2nd MV40 in a time of 34:53. Green was followed closely by the fast-improving Dan Bazzard in 15th place overall and a time of 35:44.

Another recent club signing, Alex Johnston, finished in 47th place in a time of 37:48, with Sam Baylis completing the A-team scorers in 52nd place and a time of 38:01. On the day, the A Team registered the best ever team performance CLC Striders have ever achieved in this highly competitive league, for a third place finish.

Almost as impressive as the flying A-teamers were the B team scorers – all finishing inside the top 100, for third place – again, a first for the club. The B team scorers were Oliver Watkins in 70th, Tom Burgess in 76th, John Comer in 77th, the returning Rustam Hemsley in 78th, Will Pearce in 90th and Sheng Peng in 94th. 

The C team runners on the day, in order of placing, were Paul Northup, Paul Lockyer, Adam Greenwood, Joel Freeland, Matt Ashman and Eoin McQuone.

The entire membership is incredibly proud of Liza and David in representing the club on the international stage – an amazing achievement for a relatively small and inclusive local running club.
