Saturday 23 March 2019 saw a CLC Striders ladies team travelling north to compete in the beautiful setting of Sutton Park across its undulating parkland in the annual Midland Spring Road Relays.

The ladies were one of more than 60 teams competing on the day, with some of the best runners from all over the Midlands ensuring the field was very strong and competitive. Legs one and three were longer legs of 5.38 miles and the remaining four legs were over the shorter 5k distance.

On the day, CLC were one of only two ladies teams from Gloucestershire competing (the other one being from Stroud) so they did their club and county proud.

**Amelia Mullins** ran the first (longer leg) setting off cautiously but then settling in and picking off many runners in the second half of her leg to finish in 38:23. She was followed by **Rachel Vines**, running a very nippy 5k leg in just 21:11 – a real achievement on a less-than flat course! **Laura Fletcher** was next up to take the second of the longer legs and she clocked a solid 41:28. At the half-way point, the ladies had held the position that Amelia established for them on her first leg.

The remaining three 5k legs were run by **Nicola Weager**, **Becky Reynolds** and **Charlie Haward**. All ran amazingly consistent and similar times of 25:28, 25:27 and 25:52 respectively, ensuring that the team finished in 35thplace overall on the day – out of more than 60 teams – in a cumulative time of 2:57:49.
