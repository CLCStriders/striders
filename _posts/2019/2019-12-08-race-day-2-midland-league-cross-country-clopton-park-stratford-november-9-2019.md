Once again hosted by Spa Striders, the second fixture of the Midland League Cross Country season for the CLC Striders Ladies and Men’s teams took place across the testing terrain of Clopton Park in Stratford on Avon. After weeks of rain, race day came after a few dry days, but the ground was still muddy and heavy going.

In their incredibly strong Division One, the ladies achieved 3 top-50 placings on the day and 13th place in the team competition overall. **Liza Barry** was first home in 31st place and a time of 29:29. Liza was followed home by the dynamic duo of **Karlien Heyrman** and **Helen Knight**, this time only a second apart in 43rd and 44th place and 30:26 and 30:27 respectively. Fourth home for the team scorers was evergreen **Amelia Mullins** in 81stplace and a time of 32:35. **Fiona Brady-Miller** finished in 90th place and **Rachel Vines** in 102nd.
