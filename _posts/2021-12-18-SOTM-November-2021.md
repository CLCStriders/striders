Congratulations to Emma Abbey who is our Strider of the Month for November 2021.

A regular at club training sessions, Emma always puts in maximum effort and stepped up for the Ladies in the first race of the Midland League XC season at Betley Court Farm in November. Emma had a really strong and determined run, finishing 3rd scorer for the ladies team in a time of 32:39. 

Emma also had a good run in the recent 2nd race of the season in Stratford, finishing in 37:26 for 83rd in her category.

Well done Emma....and Merry Christmas
