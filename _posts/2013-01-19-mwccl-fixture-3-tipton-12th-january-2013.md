The course was set in the beautiful Sandwell country park near Birmingham. The route took the ladies on a great tour of the park as the zig zagged accross the fields. Conditions were good but the recent rain had left the ground somewhat boggy in places.

Liza Barry started conservatively in the first small lap but once she had got into her stride she was gaining places. Barry was first home for the club and finished in a respectable 43rd place. Not far behind was Trish Woods. Woods put in the usual gritty performance to finish in 56th place. 3rd to score was Amanda Steer who ran well to finish in 73rd place.

Finally Rebecca Boulton completed the squad to finish in an encouraging 145th place.
