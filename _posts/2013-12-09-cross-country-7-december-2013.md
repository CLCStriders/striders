The men were competing in their second Division Two fixture of the season. After suffering during a gruelling opening weekend, the men went to Nuneaton in determined mood and fought hard to pull back almost 300 points and finish in a well deserved 14th place. After this gritty display the men are still fighting to avoid relegation, but now have a chance of staying up. Finishing positions were:

22 Will Ferguson 37.23  
41 Chris Driskell 38.35  
104 Jo Maddocks 41.28  
105 Rich Shardlow 41.32  
111 Dave Smeath 41.38  
149 JJ Willson 43.37

Finishing positions and times were:

54 Jo Wilkie 26.35  
77 Rachel Vines 27.52
