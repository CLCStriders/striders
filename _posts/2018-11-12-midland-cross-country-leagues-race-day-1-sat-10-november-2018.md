In their first fixture in Division 1 of the Midland League, after securing promotion last season, the CLC ladies team travelled to Counden Park in Coventry.  They did themselves and the club proud in their first appearance in this tough league, with three top 100 finishers.

First home was the ever-reliable **Helen Knight**, in 52<sup>nd </sup>place and a time of 24:27. She was followed home by **Karlien Heyrman** in 64<sup>th </sup>place and a time of 25:10. Third finisher was vet **Amelia Mullins** who ran superbly to win 82<sup>nd </sup>place in a time of 26:09.

Fast returning to form, **Rachel Vines** finished in 104<sup>th </sup>place in a time of 27:04, **Laura Fletcher** turned in a great run for 119<sup>th </sup>place in 27:48, **Nicola Weager** was 126<sup>th </sup>in 27:56, and **Cerys Jones** was 162<sup>nd </sup>in 30:21.

A mark of just how competitive the Division 1 League is, is that the ladies finished in 13<sup>th </sup>place over all, a really solid start to their campaign at the top of the Midlands Cross Country scene.

Meanwhile, in Division 2, the CLC men travelled to Worcester to compete across a classic cross country course at Cob House Country Park. A great turnout saw the men enter three teams on the day. With a few of the club’s best cross country competitors absent, the men really stepped up and turned in some stellar performances on the day.
