The May weekend after the Coronation saw CLC Striders proving what a diverse, inclusive, committed and competitive club they are, with athletes involved in a wide range of different events and disciplines all over the country – from track to trail and from the road to triathlon.

### ROAD

#### Bourton Mile, Friday 12 May

On a grey and gusty evening, seven CLC Striders athletes lined up among the field for the annual Bourton Mile. In the usual mad dash back into the village centre along the Rissington Road, Joel Freeland finished first for CLC in a blistering new MV40 club record time of 5:15. Hot on his heels was Rusty Hemsley, in a super-quick 5:17. Paul Lockyer was next to finish in a season’s best 5:26 and next home was Kate Telford, as first lady overall in the race, setting a new club and LV35 record in the process in a time of 5:37. Paul Northup clocked 5:41 and Rachel Vines was the third lady overall on the night in a time of 5:48. The final finisher for the club was Julia Rose in 7:01.

#### Bristol Half Marathon and 10k, Sunday 14 May

Down in Bristol, Joe Willgoss ran 1:15:26 for 16th place in the Bristol Half Marathon on a warm morning and the day after placing first at the Cheltenham parkrun! While Liza Bradshaw clocked 41:18 in the 10k, earning England Masters qualification in the process.

### TRAILS

#### The Lap Clockwise, Windermere, Saturday 13 May

Helen Knight completed this gruelling trail ultra in a time of just 9 hours and 29 minutes to finish as the third lady and in ninth place overall. The course comprised 46.5 miles in a clockwise direction around Lake Windemere in the Lake District. Helen’s account makes it sound magical:

“Started at 6am in the mist on the western shore. Passed through Ambleside to see parkrun being set up then rose above the mist climbing Wansfell. From there on in it was hot sunshine all the way.  I finished 3rd lady and 19th overall in 9 hours 29 minutes. A most enjoyable way to spend the weekend.”

#### South Downs Way Trail Marathon, Sunday 14 May

The club’s ultra, ultra-man Rob Bircher completed the South Downs Way Trail Marathon as a route recce for a longer event he has coming up. Comprising 28 miles and over 4,300 ft of ascent, he was characteristically enthusiastic about what a wonderful event and experience it was.

#### UTS (Snowden Trail Ultra), Saturday 13 May

Meanwhile, as an illustration of just how demanding such ultras are, club runner Oliver Watkins was forced to retire from his Snowden Ultra just shy of 40 miles in. Having enjoyed a great 30km start to the ultra, the heat started to get to Watkins and, having had no sleep the night before he found himself increasingly running on empty.
