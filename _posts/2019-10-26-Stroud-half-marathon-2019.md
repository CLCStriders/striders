On a bright, crisp, chilly late October morning – and having enjoyed an extra hour in bed with the switch back to GMT – a crop of CLC Striders took their places among 2,000 or so starters for the popular annual Stroud Half Marathon.

Tom Kabala led the way home with a solid top-50 finish in a time of 1:21:53. Next to finish for the club were Liza Barry, continuing her strong return to racing and finishing in 1:31:52, and Karlien Heyrman in 1:32:50.

Finishing close together, Sarah Richards registered 1:33:39 and Finlay Willicott 1:33:46. Fiona Brady-Miller ran a new half marathon PB time of 1:35:54 and she was followed home by Rachel Vines in 1:36:32 and Amelia Mullins in 1:36:57.     

Andrew Gage ducked in under 1 hour 40 minutes in 1:39:50, Nicola Weager clocked 1:46:40, Mike Speke 1:49:00 and Mat Benfield 1:50:20.
