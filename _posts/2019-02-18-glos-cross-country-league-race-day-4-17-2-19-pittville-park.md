On an unseasonably mild afternoon, CLC Striders ladies and men’s teams turned out to complete their cross-country seasons in the local event hosted by Cheltenham Harriers across the familiar ground of Pittville Park.

For the ladies especially, it was to mark the end of another very strong season, with the ladies vet team finishing in first place on the day and second place across the four races; and with individual honours going to Helen Knight, with a bronze in her LV35 category, and to Amelia Mullins and Amanda Steer for silver and bonze respectively in their LV45 age category.
