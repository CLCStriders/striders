&#8220;I was very pleased to be first Senior Lady in 20:37 (just 14 seconds behind the vet35 winner) in a big field of almost 160 competitors. Also pleased with the time over what is advertised as an â€˜undulating/flatâ€™ course â€“ why didnâ€™t I read that description first?! The course takes in footpaths/trails around a lake, but also spirals up and over a pedestrian motorway bridge, and then back again, which definitely made it a bit tough!&#8221;
