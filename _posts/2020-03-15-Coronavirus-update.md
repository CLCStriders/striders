In light of some feedback from members, the committee has been reviewing the situation around Covid-19 and the training on Monday and Wednesday evenings. As the impact of the virus becomes more significant, we must safeguard the health and wellbeing of our members, especially true for those with caring responsibilities, and members who have elderly relatives or those in other vulnerable groups, and be aware of the risk of the virus being spread at club led events.

We are proposing to continue with training on Monday nights for the foreseeable future either until government advice is such that we are required to stop, or CLC determines they need to close. As previously mentioned, we will meet outside CLC sports centre rather than inside and politely request that everyone utilises social distancing as appropriate, especially for those who may wish to run alone. If you are showing any symptoms such as a cough, high temperature or fever we kindly ask that you refrain from attending training.

The committee are in the process of reviewing arrangements for Wednesday night speed training and identifying if any changes ought to be applied to the sessions. We will communicate with you all once arrangements have been finalised.

We are also waiting to hear if the road relays will take place on Saturday and will inform those who have agreed to race as soon as a decision is taken. If you no longer wish to participate it would be appreciated if you could let Will or Karlien aware (or by reply if easier).

Can I remind you all of the UK Government advice to support the UK's response by:

* following public health authorities' advice, for example on [hand washing](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/best-way-to-wash-your-hands/)

* reducing the impact and spread of misinformation by relying on information from trusted sources, such as that on [www.nhs.uk](http://www.nhs.uk/), and [www.gov.uk](http://www.gov.uk/)   

* checking and following the latest [FCO travel advice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus) when travelling and planning to travel

* ensuring you and your family's [vaccinations](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/nhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/) are up to date as this will help reduce the pressure on the NHS through reducing vaccine-preventable diseases

* checking on elderly or vulnerable family, friends and neighbours 

* using NHS 111, pharmacies and GPs responsibly, and go to the hospital only when you really need to. This is further explained on the NHS website  - [www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergencycare/when-to-go-to-ae/](http://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergencycare/when-to-go-to-ae/)

* being understanding of the pressures the health and social care systems may be under, and receptive to changes that may be needed to the provision of care to you and your family.

* accepting that the advice for managing COVID-19 for most people will be [self-isolation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-self-isolation-for-patients-undergoing-testing/advice-sheet-home-isolation) at home and simple over-the-counter medicines.

* checking for new advice as the situation changes.
