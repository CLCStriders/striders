15 years ago our Founder and Club President, Brendan Ward, set up CLC Striders. The club was formally established in April 2008 with the first competitive race being entered in August 2008. It is therefore timely to celebrate this momentous occasion.

What a 15 years it has been, especially with the clubs 14th year seeing the men’s and ladies’ teams promoted to Division 1 in the Birmingham League XC, an aspiration Bren had for the club since founding it. And let’s not forget successes in the road relays, members representing the county and even England alongside endless PBs and successes at various races throughout the years. The list could go on and on.

Out of the 106 members currently with the club, 12 have been members since the early years and remain active with the club:

* Amanda Steer
* Amelia Mullins
* Chris Driskell
* Joanna Thomson
* Joel Freeland
* Jon Howes
* Liza Bradshaw
* Nikki Smith
* Rachael Cary
* Rachel Vines
* Rebecca Reynolds
* Will Ferguson

We hope to speak to some of these members and share their founding stories this autumn as we remember our club history - more to follow.

The club would not be what it is today without each and every one of its members who have been such a part of the club over the years. The club exists for its members and its members are the club. 15 years on from humble beginnings, it’s inspirational to see so many Striders racing on a regular basis, attending training, training together and dedicating themselves to continual improvement. For a small club, we really do punch above our weight.

Here is to the next 15 years! We can’t wait to see what is yet to come....
