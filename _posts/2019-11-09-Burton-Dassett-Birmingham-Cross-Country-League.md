Hosted by Spa Striders, the first fixture of the Midland League Cross Country season (2019-2020) for the CLC Striders Ladies and Men’s teams took place in the rolling parkland at Burton Dassett Country Park on Saturday 9th November. In conditions that saw lashing rain combine with gusting winds and bitterly cold temperatures, the event demanded true grit and determination from all the runners. And the CLC athletes delivered in spades.

In the ultra competitive Division 1, the ladies came in 12th place overall on the day, with strong performances from their top four scorers. Liza Barry marked her return to this regional level of competition with a 38th place and a time of 31:11. Not far behind, Rachel Vines finished in 52nd place with a time of 31:45. Helen Knight was 60th in 32:22 and Fiona Brady-Miller was the fourth team scorer in 101st place and a time of 34:52. There were also brave runs from Nicola Weager in 128th place, Laura Daubney in 155th and Sarah Wilson in 180th.
