Please see interval session below, this week set by coach Brendan Ward.

1 mile easy warm up followed by dynamic mobility, drills and strides. Then:

* 2 x 6minutes @10k pace (3mins slow jog recovery)
* 2 x 3minutes @5k pace (90secs slow jog recovery)
* 2 x 90seconds @3k pace (60secs slow jog recovery)
* 2 x 45seconds @1500m pace (45secs slow jog recovery)
(Total efforts = 22.5 minutes)

Easy cool down jog and static stretch all the main muscles.

Please adhere to the rules, only train if you feel fit & healthy and remember you CAN train together with 1 other person outside - so please reach out to other members/friends if you want some company.

Good luck to everyone running in the club Virtual Competition this week, if you plan to do this session, please allow a good amount of time to recover before doing your virtual effort.

Enjoy.
