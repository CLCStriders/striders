The club had a marvellous morning coming away with the men&#8217;s winner who was John Parker, JP suffered very badly in the last 2k with a stitch, and by his standards had to slow down to a jog; however, he had built up such a lead during the race, he could still take a comfortable county series win. Chris Hugh Driskell recorded a respectable 37.41, and was one place ahead of team mate Dave Smeath who recorded 38.32. Rachel DJ Vines who is slowly returning to form, ran a well paced race to win the women&#8217;s prize from team mate Sian Holley who put in an excellent performance to finish only two seconds behind Vines. Emma Skeen (the Cockney Sparrow) followed Holley and helped seal the women&#8217;s team prize running a swift 43.02.

Other notable performances came from Nick Von Benzon who set a new Men&#8217;s 55-59 Club record with a time of 44.40, and Sarah Bellwood who dug in deep to run 52.58.
