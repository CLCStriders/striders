The Fab Four did themselves Proud at the ERRA National Road Relay Championships at Sutton Park.

Rachel DJ Vines set off on leg 1 and ran strongly to finish in 59th Place (17.36)  
Natasha Poole ran a storming leg overtaking 14 runners to finish in 45th place (16.20)  
Jo Wilkie put in a solid run to finish in 50th place (19.04)

This was the Clubs first National relay experience &#8211; very well done the Fab Four!
