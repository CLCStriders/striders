On a perfectly bright and calm February morning, 13 Striders joined runners from all over the region for the annual Bourton 10k, long established as the best test over this iconic distance in the early part of the year. With the winner clocking a time just outside 30 minutes, the quality of the field was, once again, very high – and Striders athletes did themselves proud, many of them achieving PBs along the way.

**Jon Howe**s led the Striders home in a gutsy 46<sup>th </sup>place and a time of 37:36.4 – a great achievement, life having got in the way of the miles Jon usually puts in each week. Next home was a comfortable **Will Pearce**, using the race as part of a longer half marathon test run, in 49<sup>th </sup>place and a time of 37:40.4**. **Not too far behind the lead pair was **Clark Lawson**, bagging a massive PB in a time of **38:11.8 **in 58<sup>th </sup>place

The next pair home were **JJ Willson** and **Gareth Harries** in 41:26.6 and 41:44.4 respectively in 138<sup>th </sup>and 144<sup>th </sup>places. First lady home for the club was **Amanda Steer** in 165th place and a time of 42:20.7. Not far behind her was **Rachel Vines** in 172<sup>nd </sup>place and a time of 42:45.8. **Hedley Phillips** was rewarded for his hard work at training over the winter, clocking a massive PB of 43:18.8 in 183<sup>rd </sup>place.

**Gary Smith** was 213<sup>th </sup>in a time of 44:45.8 and **Ed Collier** was 240<sup>th </sup>in 45:44.4. **Helen Howes** produced a lifetime best in 252<sup>nd </sup>place for a new, hard-fought PB time of 46:29.2. **Mike Speke** earned a PB time of 47:54.8 in 294<sup>th </sup>place, **Dave Mayo** was 393<sup>rd </sup>in 52:14.1 and **Charlie Haward** was 403<sup>rd </sup>in 53:03.9.
