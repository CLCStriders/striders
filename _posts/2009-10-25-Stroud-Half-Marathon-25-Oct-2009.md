**The Stroud Half Marathon 25 October 2009**

**<a name="Report"></a><a name="Report"></a>Report**

17 CLC Striders competed in the Stroud Half Marathon today, in a field of 1738 runners. The sunshine quickly deteriorated into wind and rain, but in true Striders style they didn?t let the weather impair their performances. 

Rich Dare led the team home, breaking the 80 minute barrier. Laura Kent was first F35 (and 6th woman overall), in a hugely impressive 1:22:15, a new club record. Behind her, GPS won an epic battle with Dave to set a new M40 club record. There were PBs aplenty from other Striders, including Ian Daniels who set a new M45 club record in 01:34:40. Special mention should also go to Paul Jenkins, who completed the race inside 2 hours despite an injury-riddled build up. 

Well done all, some very impressive performances
