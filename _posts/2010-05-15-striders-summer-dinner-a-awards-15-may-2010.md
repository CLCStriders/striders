CLC Striders had a fantastic night packed with fun at the Clubs 2nd year anniversary dinner held at the Beehive Pub in Montpellier Cheltenham on Saturday 15th May 2010. Twelve awards were presented this year which made it even more exciting for me personally to present.

Well done to Chris Slade (Social Sec) for organising the event, a massive thank you to Siri (Ross Aldridge) who very kindly supplied the Wine, and a big congratulations to all the Award Winners and to everyone else who attended and made it real fun.

Thanks.

Brendan Ward (Chairman)
