On a cold and grey early January afternoon, CLC Striders athletes made their way to the beautiful setting of the Churn river valley, between Cheltenham and Cirencester in the grounds of Rendcombe School. The event was the annual Gloucestershire Cross Country Championships, the perfect way to banish the excesses of the Christmas season. The course proved a brilliant cross country challenge, complete with hills, descents, multi-terrain and a crossing of the River Churn itself!

Once again, the club’s ladies led the way. For the first time this season, **Karlien Keyrman** led the club home with a great 11th placing overall as the 6<sup>th </sup>senior lady finisher. She was followed home in 14<sup>th </sup>place overall by **Helen Knight**, who earned 3<sup>rd </sup>place in her LV35 category.

The ever-improving **Rachel Vines** registered 22<sup>nd </sup>place overall as the 5<sup>th </sup>finisher in her LV35 category. And the ladies performance was topped off with **Amanda Steer** finishing 27<sup>th </sup>overall, as the 3<sup>rd </sup>in her LV45 category, and **Amelia Mullins** in 31<sup>st </sup>overall as 5<sup>th </sup>in her LV45 category.

Overall, the ladies achieved a strong 4<sup>th </sup>placing in both the senior and vets categories.

Next, it was the turn of the men to test themselves across the beautiful parkland terrain and they performed well too. In particular, **David James** finished 1<sup>st </sup>in his MV65 category and **John Willson** finished 2<sup>nd </sup>in his MV55 category. In addition, vets **Paul Lockyer** and **Eoine McQuone** were 47<sup>th </sup>and 64<sup>th </sup>overall. And in the team standings on the day, the men finished 8<sup>th </sup>in the vets competition.
