As the track season ends, CLC Striders were busy proving their prowess over much longer distances this last weekend.

On Sunday 17 September, three striders – **Rob Bircher,** **Andrew Paterson and Betty the dog** – travelled up to the Peak District to the Ladybower and Derwent reservoirs, famous as the site where the Lancaster bombers trained before their dam-busting war-time excursion.

In what was a very friendly and low-key event in stunning surroundings, Andrew and Betty the dog competed together over the 21-mile distance, finishing in an amazing time of 3.11.57 as the first canicross competitors. Meanwhile, testing himself over the longest distance he’s ever run, Rob ran three-and-a-bit times around the reservoirs, completing the grueling 51-mile course (yes, that’s 51 miles!) in a time of 9 hours and 13 minutes in a fantastic 13th place overall, smashing his target time of 10 and a half hours by some margin.

On the same day, but over shorter distances and closer to home, **Sophie Longmore** continued her stunning year by finishing as 28<sup>th</sup> lady in the Simply Health Great Bristol Half Marathon in a PB time of 1:30:42. Over the same distance in a different city, **Kyle Sollars** bettered his old half marathon PB by a massive 10 minutes, finishing the Worcester Half in 1:44:15. And **Gordon Bendall** paced a friend around the same course in a time of 2:08:39.
