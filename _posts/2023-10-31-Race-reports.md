### Saturday 28 October 
 
#### North Yorkshire Moors Marathon
 
[Helen Knight](/images/2023/10/2023-10-31-Helen-Knight.jpg "Helen Knight") competed in what she described as a ‘mud fest’ across the trails of the North Yorkshire Moors. Although slow (by her standards), Helen still completed this gruelling event, with its 3,181 ft of ascent, in 4 hours and 12 minutes, finishing as first lady.
 
#### Marathon Eryri, Snowdonia, Wales
 
Meanwhile, Liza Bradshaw was running the marathon distance in another of the UK’s National Parks. Despite not feeling great and struggling with foot cramps on this challenging course, Liza still recorded a fantastic time of 3 hours and 33 minutes.
 
### Sunday 29 October 2023
 
#### Stroud Half Marathon
 
Much closer to home and running the half marathon distance in near-perfect conditions, [six Striders](/images/2023/10/2023-10-31-Stroud-Half.jpg "six Striders") lined up to do their best in this iconic local event. Running to raise money for local charity Winston’s Wish, Rob Barnett was first home for the club, with a top 10 finish in a superb PB time of 1:17:57. Next to finish was young club newcomer Ben Cooper who ran his second sub 85-minute half marathon, in a time of 1:24:38. Struggling with a virus, vet  Paul Northup ducked in under the 90-minute mark in his fastest half marathon time for a good while – 1:29:06. Matt Ashman was hampered by an awkward glute tightness, finishing in a time of 1:39:26. Colin Upton clocked 1:48:58 and debutante Tanya Evans achieved her sub-two-hour target in 1:57:16.
 
#### Lightning Bolt 10k, Chippenham
 
[Adam Greenwood](/images/2023/10/2023-10-31-Adam-Greenwood.jpg "Adam Greenwood") travelled south to compete in the fast and flat 10k at Langley Burrell in Wiltshire. Many of the roads were flooded, making for an interesting race, and Adam finished in 39:09.
