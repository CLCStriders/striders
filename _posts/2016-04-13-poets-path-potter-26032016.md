<span class="">Nicholas von Benzon and daughter, Elena, competed in the Poets’ Path Potter on Saturday 26</span><sup class="">th</sup><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif"><span class=""> March.  This is a great event for those who enjoy running through the Gloucestershire countryside without the pressure of getting a PB.  The event starts from Dymock and there is a choice of 4 distances, 8,10, 16 and 26 miles using three circular waymarked routes the Poets’ Paths 1 and 2 and the Daffodil Way.  No marshalls, you get given a map and follow the waymarks so its nice to run it with a friend; there’s a question to answer on the way just to make sure you don’t take a short cut!  Running together, Nicholas and Elena did the 10 mile route along the Daffodil Way and finished 2</span></span><sup class="">nd</sup><span class=""> equal (well they ran together) out of 21 entrants.  A total of 86 entrance competed over the 4 distances.  Perhaps other Striders will come and join the fun, because it was fun, next year!  </span>
