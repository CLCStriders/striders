Congratulations to Cat Wheeler who is our Strider of the Month for August.

Cat has been training incredibly hard recently, regularly clocking over 50 miles a week (and some 60+!) with some very strong runs as she trains for her Virtual Marathon in October! In August, Cat did a 1.33 training half marathon at 5.30am in the morning! She has also been a regular at Wednesday speed training sessions & is improving all the time.

Good luck with the Marathon Cat, sure you will smash it!

Well done.
