#### Telford 10k - Sunday 14 December 
 
11 CLC Striders journeyed north to compete in the annual Telford 10k. Set off in waves based on anticipated finishing times, the renowned flat and fast course attracts runners from all over in search of a PB as the year closes out. And our athletes were among them, setting PBs galore.

First home was Tom Fletcher, in a new PB time of just 35:18 – all his weekly mileage and faithful commitment to interval sessions well and truly paid off. London Marathon 2026, here comes Tom! Also setting a blsiteringly fast time was Gavin Woods, who smashed his own expectations with a superb new PB time of 36:30. Will McNeile also ran really strongly to register a 10k PB time of 37:31.

Next came a trio of Striders, all crossing the line inside the magic 40-minute mark. Jamie Hartnoll clocked 39:22, Andy Richardson bagged his second sub-40 10k of the year in 39:48 and a determined Luke Hunter timed his run perfectly for 39:55.

Just outside 40 minutes, but inside 41 were Tom Barlow in 40:17, Ashley Wilson in 40:36 and Nick Ledwold in 40:56. Nia Comley ran a time of 45:57 and super-vet David James clocked 49:16, finishing second in his V75 age category.

All in all, a great morning's racing for the club and a great way to finish the road racing year.
