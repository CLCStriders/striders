Congratulations to David James who is our Strider of the Month for November.

David has been running incredibly well the last few months, with consistent training and a regular at club speed sessions. 

He was finally able to put this hard work into a Race in November on the track at the POW 5k time trials, where he ran a brilliant 21.57 (with the floodlights out!) to claim another Club Record! A few weeks later, David then ran his own solo half marathon time trial, from Cheltenham & out round the famous Boddington loop and back, in a superb 1 hour 40 minutes.

Will David claim another club record at the Westonbirt 10k this weekend?

Well done David
