With temperatures having lifted, but with wind and squally showers to contend with, CLC Striders Ladies and Men’s teams turned out for the fourth and final races in their respective 2107/18 Midland League Division Two campaigns on **Saturday 10th February**.

The ladies journeyed north to compete in Wolverhampton, while the men welcomed clubs from all over the region to a race they devised and hosted themselves in the picturesque grounds of the National Star College at Ullenwood, just outside Cheltenham.

Outstanding team achievement of the day and season belonged to the women, earning promotion from Division Two to One with yet another stellar performance across testing terrain around Aldersley Stadium in Wolverhampton.

Completing her best season in the Midland League to date, the CLC Ladies were once again led home by **Karlien Heyrman** in 17th place as the 10th senior in a time of 25:14. 24th overall, **Helen Knight** finished 8th in the masters in a time of 25:59. She was followed closely by **Amanda Steer** and **Amelia Mullins**, 31st and 34th overall respectively, finishing 13th and 14th in the masters category in times of 26:56 and 27:16.

**Nicola Weager** bagged her best finish of the season with 47th overall as 19th senior in 28:12 and **Laura Fletcher** was 67th overall in 29:30 as 26th senior finisher. In her fist season with the club **Cerys Jones** completed her Midland series in 87th place overall as the 51st masters finisher and in 97th place overall **Jill Hooper** was the 37th senior finisher in 30:59.

On the day, the ladies teams finished 2nd in the masters and 5th in the seniors. But all importantly, in both the seniors _and_ masters, CLC Ladies finished the series of four races in second place overall, earning a richly deserved promotion to compete at the highest level next season (an achievement which demonstrates the club’s strength in depth, given two of their most experienced performers missed the season).

Meanwhile, closer to home, the men battled it out in their own race, held at Ullenwood. Once again, the men turned out in force, with three full teams competing on the day.
