In the first running of the race, Martin set a new PB of 1:36:32, beating his previous time of 1:41:29, and finishing 313th out of 2232. The day started off dry but with a slight chill in the air and began in the picturesque grounds of Warwick Castle before going out into the village to be met by a lot of support from the locals. It continued out of Warwick on an undulating course around nearby villages before returning back to the castle. By mile 5 the dry weather turned to rain and around mile 9 it changed from rain to snow with Martin finishing &#8220;very wet but extremely happy with my time and being proud of wearing the club vest for the first time&#8221;. Well done, Martin!
