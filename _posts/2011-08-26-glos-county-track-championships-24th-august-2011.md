The action kicked off with the 10,000 metres which is 25 laps of the track, this event challenges you both mentally and physically, and pace judgment is vital. There was a large field of runners taking part and it was inevitable that there would be lap counting issues, unfortunately this found John Parker (JP) finishing two laps short while leading the race. Five other Striders competed and acquitted themselves really well with Chris Driskell having a superb run to clinch the County senior Bronze medal in an excellent 37.18.7 which was a new personal best time for the track, Charles Goodwin followed Driskell and ran strongly throughout, setting a new Club V45 record and Pb time of 38.17.3, Hilary Agate ran an excellent race to take the County women's title and set a new club record and Pb time of 39.16.1 to boot, Adam Cary made his track debut and ran well to record 42.02.4, Final finisher for the Club was Malc Smith who amazingly set a new Pb time having run a Marathon only four days before. Smith recorded a time of 46.43.4.

Meanwhile in the Mile events Rachel Vines ran well to set a new club record and Pb time of 5.51.7, Jo Wilkie ran just over six minutes and put in a solid performance, Rich Cannock recorded an encouraging 5.23.9, and Chris Hale ran well to set a new Pb and M40 Club record time of 5.30.2.

The Club's men and women made their debut in the 4 x 400 metre relay events and did surprisingly well coming away with one Gold, One Silver and a well earned Bronze medal.

Well done to all of you, and thanks for making it such an entertaining eveningâ€™s athletics.
