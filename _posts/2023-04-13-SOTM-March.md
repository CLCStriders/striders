Congratulations to Ryan O'Donnell who is our Strider of the Month for March 2023.

Ryan travelled to Omagh at the end of March to compete in the Omagh Half Marathon. He had a storming run, pacing the race perfectly to a new PB time of 1:24:47 to finish 107th overall.

Ryan has been a regular at training & club speed sessions in recent months, so this result came as no surprise. He also completed the Fission 20 Mile Race in March, clocking a time of 2:25:16 as part of his training for the Manchester Marathon. Ryan has unfortunately decided to withdraw from this year's marathon, having faced a few hurdles which affected his training schedule. However, we are sure to see his good form continuing in races over the Summer.

Well done Ryan.
