**Palestine Half Marathon, Manchester Marathon and Solihull Half Marathon**

** ****From the West Bank to the West Midlands: CLC Striders were everywhere last weekend**

** **On Friday 31 March, CLC Strider Paul Northup ran in the fifth Palestine Marathon held in Bethlehem in the West Bank. Running the half marathon distance, he finished 14th in a large field of local Palestinian and international runners, clocking a modest one and half hours on the incredibly tough, hilly and hot course.

Meanwhile, closer to home, in the Cheltenham Parkrun on Saturday 1 April, Strider Iain Porter finished in first place with a time of 17:56, just two seconds outside his course best. And elsewhere, Gareth Davies ran as a “tourist” in the Parkrun at Highbury in London, clocking a sharp 19.38 and finishing 20th.

On Sunday 2 April ultra-man Andrew Paterson and marathon debutante Mike Speke tackled the iconic Manchester Marathon on a surprisingly hot and sunny morning. Andrew completed the 26.2 miles in 3:45:54 and Mike finished his first outing over this distance in 4:52:05. Further south on Sunday, Emma Abbey continued her prolific form by running the inaugural Solihull Half Marathon and completing the hilly course in 1:52:02, just two weeks after setting a club record in the Gloucester 20-mile road race.
