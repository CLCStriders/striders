**The Frampton 10k 12 July 2010** </p> 

**Report**

On a lovely evening in a picturesque village, JP notched up an other victory with a commanding performance at the Frampton 10k ?cider race?. Taking advantage of excellent running conditions on a flat course, he quickly established himself in the lead group of 4, maintaining his position before pulling away in the final 400m to win comfortably in 32.53. Performance of the day for the Striders was Chris Hale (aka GPS) who incredibly, managed to knock a full minute off his previous best set only 4 months previously at Bourton with a time of 36.50, also a V40 club record. He shrewdly held himself back over the first 2 miles, tracking Dave Smeath (who also improved on his Bourton performance by actually making it out of the village!) before pulling away. Smeath was not far behind in 37.05, also a big PB. Paul Smith showed he is well on the way to recovery after injury with a time of 39.15. Brother Mark finished in 47.42 (back to the drawing board on that ?one run per week? training regime I think Mark?) Lucy McNulty, in her first race back since having a baby, was first lady Strider home in 47.14. Completing the Striders line up was the fast finishing (grandstanding?!) Trudi Jones with an excellent 48.24

The evening was rounded off with a cider for every finisher and a barbecue on the village green?what?s not to like? We really ought to get a few more of us doing this one next year!</p>
