Dave Smeath, Liza Barry and Guy Sabey all remembered to reset their clocks and took part in Cheltenham Harriers Cleevewold Race on Sunday 25th March. The race is 14.2M of tough hilly multiterrain up, over and around Cleeve Hill. Conditions were dry and warm, and Cleeve looked fantastic in the sunshine (though of course our dedicated athletes were working far too hard to notice the view!). Smeath clocked up a top 10 finish, coming home 8th in 01:49:33. Liza was 17th overall, and first lady in 01:55:24. Guy, a Cleevewold veteran, finished in 02:10:42 to complete the Striders trio. Hugo Driskell and DJV also enjoyed the race, topping up their tans marshalling at 12M. Finally,thanks to Brendan and Seb for their support!
