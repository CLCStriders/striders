**Reading Half, Bath Half, Gloucester 20 and** **Berkeley 20  
16 and 17 March, 2019**

On a blustery March weekend, CLC Striders athletes took to the roads again to test themselves over the longer distances – many running half marathons and some tackling the even longer challenge of 20 miles.

**Reading Half, 17.3.19**

In Reading, **Will Ferguson** took on the half marathon distance as part of his training for the London Marathon in April. Translating all his hard miles of preparation into the race day scenario, Ferguson smashed his Half PB, ducking in under 1 hour and 10 minutes and setting a new club record of 69:54. A great run by any standards, in the gusting winds and over a less-than flat course, this blistering time augers well for Ferguson’s marathon debut in a little over a month.

Struggling with a groin niggle which meant him having to run defensively, **Will Pearce** clocked a disciplined 83:05. Meanwhile, **Oliver Watkins** set a superb new PB of 1:25:39, his fastest half time for over 19 years.

**Bath Half, 17.3.19**

At the iconic Bath Half event, **Tim Brock**, **Gary Smith** and **Charlie Haward** all set new PB times. Vet Tim smashed his previous best time by over 5 minutes, clocking a superb 1:35:30. Gary Smith registered well under his previous best on the day, finishing in 1:36:50. And Charlie completed the distance in well under two hours, in a time of 1:56:07.

**Gloucester 20, 17.3.19**

Club old boy **Mark Fuller** returned to his home turf to register a strong 2:10: 35 as part of his London Marathon training plan. Meanwhile, **Tom Fletcher** clocked 2:22:17 after taking a last-minute place, and **Hedley Phillips** surprised himself with a strong 2:37:53 as part of his Edinburgh Marathon training plan.

**Berkeley Fission 20, 16.3.19**

The day before, vet **Gavin Jerman** achieved his goal of sub 8-minute miling over the 20-mile distance, averaging 7:57/mile and completing the race around the old Berkeley Power Plant in 2:38:54.
