Congratulations to Gavin Jerman who is our Strider of the Month for April 2022.

In an incredibly selfless act at the Shepperdine Marathon in April, Gavin forfeited his own race to help fellow Strider Deborah Rees on the last lap, seeking medical assistance and helping her get back with what turned out to be a stress fracture to the hip. His words at the time were "Never leave an injured Strider"! An amazing thing to do and epitomises what club running and being a Strider is all about. We wish Deborah a speedy recovery. 

Gavin also continues with his very efficient work as our Membership Secretary and worked tirelessly throughout April updating the club records area of our website & introducing new categories for Parkrun and trail races.

Thank you for all of your efforts Gavin. Well done.
