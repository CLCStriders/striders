The CLC Striders Committee has the health and wellbeing of club members at the forefront of all decisions in relation to training and club events. The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a temporary pause to all training, followed by a return to more restricted training in small groups which have been running successfully for a few months now.

The Committee has received regular updates from England Athletics providing guidance and rules following a relaxation of the lockdown restrictions, more information can be found on the [England Athletics guidance update for restricted return to activities](https://www.englandathletics.org/athletics-and-running/news/guidance-update-for-restricted-return-to-activity-for-coaches-leaders-athletes-runners-and-facilities-step-3/). One of the key items the Committee have had to work on is a [Covid-19 Action Plan and Risk Assessment](https://clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk/assets/Covid-19-risk-assessment.pdf) which is available on the club website and regularly shared with members. Please do take the time to review this to ensure you are aware of the contents.

As you will know, as of Monday 14 September it was made illegal to socialise in groups of larger than 6 people in England. Thankfully there are some exemptions and this includes organised sport. England Athletics have provided confirmation that affiliated athletics clubs such as ours can continue to train in larger groups. They have set out some [detailed guidance](https://www.englandathletics.org/athletics-and-running/news/update-athletics-and-running-activity-will-not-be-affected-by-the-new-restrictions) in this regard.

At this time CLC Striders will continue to operate as if has been over the past few weeks, with Mondays as a 4-6 mile social run with pace-based groups of 2-6 runners and Wednesday interval sessions organised on a sign-up basis. This enables members to enjoy their running and push themselves whilst enabling the club to welcome new runners to join in with our fantastic activities. 

The Committee will continue to monitor guidance and government advice to ensure we adhere to the rules set out and maintain a Covid safe environment for members.
