The local parkrun is held every Saturday at 9am to run 5km around Pittville park and is a regular event for a number of Striders. The event attracted 350 runners from a wide range of running abilities and even attracted &#8220;parkrun tourists&#8221; from Southampton and London.

The club were invited to fill all volunteer positions at the event and due to so many Striders offering their support for the event it meant that we were able to offer the parkrun's first ever &#8220;pacing day&#8221; with pacers from 19 minutes through to 30 minutes.

Thanks to the following Striders who took up non-running roles:

  * Clark **LAWSON** for being the days run director.
  * Chris **DRISKELL** & Gordon **BENDALL** for timekeeping.
  * Louise **LAWSON**, Claire **SANSOME** & Louise **ALLSOP** for barcode scanning.
  * Dan **HARTE** & Amanda **PILL** for handing out the finishing tokens.
  * Jon **HOWES**, Helen **HOWES**, Emma **ABBEY**, JJ **WILLSON**, Miranda **STEWART**, Alison **GREGORY** and Denise **HALLAM** for marshalling out on the course
  * Joel **FREELAND** for taking excellent photos.

In addition to those, we were able to have some running roles (some with the pressure of pacing):

  * Our tail runner was Dave **MAYO****.**
  * Alice **JOHNSTON** guided a blind runner around the course.
  * Juan **MORENO**, Chris **HALE**, Jon **BIRD**, Rachel **VINES**, Andrew **PATERSON**, Amanda **STEER**, George **PARKER**, Rob **GLADWIN**, David **SMEATH**, Rob **BIRCHER**, Nat **LOVEKIN** & Trish **WOODS** were our pacing team guiding runners to new PBs.

At this family friendly event even some of the children of Striders got out of bed early to help out too:

  * Joseph **ABBEY** (aged 6) & Daniel **ABBEY** (aged 8) helped out their Mum marshalling out on the course to point runners onto the football pitch.
  * Sophie **HOWES** (aged 12), Jacob **HOWES** (aged 10) and Bethan **HOWES**(aged 8) helped out their Mum and Dad marshalling runners around the football pitch.

The reaction from everyone at the event was super positive with special mentions to the pacing team helping towards 106 personal bests.

Not to be outdone by others, the following club members archived new personal bests: Rachel **CARY** (19:42 & First Lady), Nicholas **VON BENZON** (24:08), Helen **RAWCLIFFE** (24:24), Charlie **HAWARD** (25:28), Nat **LOVEKIN** (29:01) & Susan **FISHER** (37:52). A special mention to a close friend of the club Helen **MAYO** who improved by 78 seconds to 35:42 and with a massive improvement of 12:18 since her first parkrun in February 2013.

The positive comments carried on after the event on both facebook and twitter:

> &#8220;@Cheltnamparkrun seems the pacers did their job (esp the 19 min guy), managed to nudge under 19 mins for the first time today&#8221;
