**The Flora London Marathon 26 April 2009**</p> 

**Report**</p> 

We had nine CLC Striders enter and finish the London Marathon today. With some fantastic performances, First home for the men was Wayne Usher making the top 400, with an impresive 2.49 performance &#8211; a new club record. First Lady home was Liza Barry in 3.16.57, 215th women home, and a new club record

Steve Elverd was well inside the 3.30 barrier in 3.27.15. Rob Lynch came home in an impresive 3.32.52. Michael Weldin finished in 3.33.40, a new club M50 record.

Alexa broke the 4-hour barrier, with a superb 3.59.16. Paul finshed in 4.20.16 and the flying Scott completed the marathon in 4.34.13

Well done, excellent effort by all.
