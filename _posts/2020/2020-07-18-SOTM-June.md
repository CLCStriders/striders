Congratulations to Amelia Mullins who is our Strider of the Month for June 2020.

There were many many miles run by Striders across the Cotswold Way in June, with fantastic efforts as part of the Cotswold Way Challenge. This wouldnâ€™t have happened without the excellent organisation by Amelia. 

Amelia, as one of our super coaches, has also been the main driving force to getting our Wednesday speed training sessions started again, which has been working so well & everyone is incredibly grateful for.

Thanks for everything you do for the Striders Amelia.
