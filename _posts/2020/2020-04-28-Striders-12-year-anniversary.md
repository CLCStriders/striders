CLC Striders today celebrate their **12th Anniversary**. 

The club was founded on the 28th April 2008 by our fantastic Head Coach and President, Brendan Ward, and has grown from a small contingent to nearly 100 members today.

The current situation prevents us from celebrating properly, it is however important to recognise this important milestone and celebrations can take place once the club is able to reconvene.
