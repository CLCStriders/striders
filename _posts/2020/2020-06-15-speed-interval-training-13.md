A couple to choose from this week, whichever you prefer....most importantly, have fun and be sensible.

1 mile warm up jog, dynamic stretches and strides. then:

* 10mins Tempo - run at 10-15 seconds per mile slower than your current 10k pace
* 5mins easy/jog (active recovery)
* 10mins Tempo - again, run at 10-15 seconds per mile slower than current 10k pace
* 5mins easy/jog recovery
* 1 mile easy Cool down and stretches at the end.

(30 minutes total for the session, with 20mins of effort)

**OR**

1 mile warm up jog, dynamic stretches and strides. then:

* 4 x 2km @10k pace (your current 10k race pace)
* 2 minutes walk/slow jog recovery between each rep

Cool down and stretch after.

Enjoy
