As we are currently unable to meet for our club sessions, the Committee have decided that every week we will release specific interval sessions to the club set by one of our coaches. You can do this on a Wednesday if you wish as usual, or any day that suits you.

We would like to encourage members to feedback on how their session went, whether that be a post on the Club Facebook group or screenshot from Strava/Garmin. Let's all keep communicating even if we can't meet!

We will obviously have to continue to follow Government advice as things develop, and please if anyone does train together, keep your distance!

SESSION for w/c 16th March (appreciate some may already have done one for this week)

Set By - Brendan Ward

4x4mins @10k pace

4x2mins @5k pace 

4x1 min @3k pace 

All with 90secs recovery between

This session will help with top end speed for 5k and 10k races.

Any questions, please just ask a member of the Committee.
