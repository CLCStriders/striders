It's virtual quiz time....

Save the date - Friday 1st May @ 8pm

Join us for an online quiz on Zoom hosted by our very own quizmaster Coach Joel. Families, couples and anyone flying solo all welcome. Teams can be assembled with some online wizardry! 

Let's let our hair down and have some fun with a quiz. No lycra required! Booze encouraged!

The Zoom meeting details containing the link to join will follow by email closer to the day. 

Take care and get swotting up!
