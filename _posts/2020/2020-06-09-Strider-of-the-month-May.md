Congratulations to Runasaurus (aka Martin Bick) who is our Strider of the Month for May 2020!

Martin has been running in this costume all over Cheltenham every day of Lockdown so far, raising smiles and lifting spirits in the community. 

Runasaurus is always in club kit, promoting the Striders and even featuring on a focus by BBC Radio Gloucestershire! Well done Martin, keep it up!
