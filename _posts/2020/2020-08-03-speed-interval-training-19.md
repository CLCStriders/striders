Here is the interval session for this week. Please note that if you are attending a club session on Wednesday the session may differ based on the coach's own preference and also suitability for the group.

1 mile warm up jog, dynamic stretches, drills and strides

The session:
* 4 x 5 minutes @ 10k pace (off 90 seconds recovery)
* 4 x 1 minute @ 3k pace (off 60 seconds recovery)
* 4 x 30 seconds @ 1mile pace (off 30 seconds recovery)

2 minutes 30 seconds recovery/rest between each set.

Minimum 1 mile cool down, jog and stretch

Don't go off too hard on the 5 minute efforts or you will pay for the rest of the session! Pace it well. Hydrate well, maintain 2 metres distance from others and don't be a litter bug.
