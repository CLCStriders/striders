Congratulations to Will Pearce, who is our Strider of The Month for April 2020.

There have been so many great achievements during Aprilâ€™s challenging lockdown conditions. We saw members completing solo marathons, taking part in virtual racing and completing weekly speed sessions on their own...please give yourselves all a big pat on the back!! ðŸ˜Š 

BUT there can only be one winner and the winner is...our one and only menâ€™s captain: William James Pearce! Will ran 42 laps around Benhall to complete a marathon in an amazing time of 2:55! He also organised the CLC virtual 5k race which encouraged a whopping 45 members to race 5k!
