Congratulations to James Babbage who is our Strider of the Month for July.

James has been a regular at Wednesday speed sessions throughout July since we have been able to train again in small groups, always putting in strong, determined effort and is coming along really well.

He also ran 102 miles on the Cotswold Way for the recent club challenge, as well as having an excellent run of Leg 1 for the virtual Cotswold Way Relay in July, in 1h 48mins! 

Well done James.
