On a wet and windy December Sunday, a good number of CLC Strider athletes travelled to the south of the county to compete in the Westonbirt 10k. Set off in waves and observing all the Covid-safe protocols, the DB-Max organised event provided a welcome chance for race-starved runners to test themselves over the 10k distance.

Proving to be more of a cross-country race than a road and trail event, there was plenty of slipping and sliding which put pay to any PB times on the day while adding to the fun. But all who competed turned in strong performances.

First home for the club was [Jacob Billingham](/images/2020/12/2020-12-17-Jacob-Billingham-Westonbirt-10k.jpg "Jacob Billingham"), in 10th place overall and a time of 40:59. Next home for the club was the always-consistent [Helen Knight](/images/2020/12/2020-12-17-Helen-Knight-Westonbirt-10k.jpg "Helen Knight"), as first in her V40 category in a time of 42:51 and [John (JJ) Willson](/images/2020/12/2020-12-17-JJ-Wilson-Westonbirt-10k.jpg "John (JJ) Willson") turned in another fine performance to bag first in his V60 category in a time of 44:39

[Rachel Vines](/images/2020/12/2020-12-17-Rachel-Vines-Westonbirt-10k.jpg "Rachel Vines") was next home for the club in a time of 46:00, closely followed by the evergreen David James who (yet again) achieved first place in his rarefied V70 category in a time of 46:09. [Joel Freeland](/images/2020/12/2020-12-17-Joel-Freeland-Westonbirt-10k.jpg "Joel Freeland") switched his coaching whistle for a run and clocked 47:09, while [Fiona Brady Miller](/images/2020/12/2020-12-17-Fiona-BM-Westonbirt-10k.jpg "Fiona Brady Miller"), returning from injury, registered 47:35, and club coach [Amelia Mullins](/images/2020/12/2020-12-17-Amelia-Mullins-Westonbirt-10k.jpg "Amelia Mullins") finished just behind her in 47:47.

Helen Howes ran strongly for a time of 48:07, with [Laura Daubney](/images/2020/12/2020-12-17-Laura-Daubney-Westonbirt-10k.jpg "Laura Daubney") finishing in 49:15, [Mike Speke](/images/2020/12/2020-12-17-Mike-Speke-Westonbirt-10k.jpg "Mike Speke") in 50:38, and Billy Bradshaw in 50:51. The remaining CLC finishers on the day were Lena Deysner, Sarah Wilson and Nicola Smith.

There were also promising signs of things to come for CLC Striders as two younger runners with parents connected with club turned in fine performances â€“ Jacob Howes coming in as first Junior in 41.53 and Archie Johnston as second Junior in 45:52.

It was a great way to end a very strange year and reminded us all at the club just how much we are all looking forward to more competition and events in 2021.
