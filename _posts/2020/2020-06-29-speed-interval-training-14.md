Here is the interval session for this week set by Joel. Please note that if you are attending a club session on Wednesday the session may differ based on the coach's own preference and also suitability for the group.

1 mile warm up jog, dynamic stretches, drills and strides

TWO sets of:
* 1 x 6 minute at Threshold pace (around 10-15 seconds per mile slower than your 10k pace)
* 2 x 3 minutes at 5k pace
* 2 x 1 minute at 3k pace 
* Take 90 seconds walk recovery between efforts and 3 minutes recovery between sets

Minimum 1 mile cool down, jog and stretch

Hydrate well, maintain 2 metres distance from others and don't be a litter bug.
