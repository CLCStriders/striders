In the calm before Storm Ciara wreaked her weekend havoc, the CLC Ladies and Men’s cross country teams ventured out of county to compete in their final race days of this year’s Midland Cross Country League – the ladies in Division 1 and the Men in Division 2.

At Newbold Comyn, near Leamington the ladies capped off another solid season by retaining their position in the highly competitive Division 1, with a standout performance from __Liza Barry__ on the day, finishing as 1st in her Masters category and 17th overall. The ever-reliable __Helen Knight__ finished in the top 50, too, in 43rd overall, as the 9th in the Masters category. __Rachel Vines__ was not far behind in 55th overall and the fourth team scorer on the day, after a season blighted by illness, was __Amanda Steer__, in 82nd place overall.

On the day, the ladies finished in 11th place overall in the team competition. But in the individual season standings, __Liza Barry__ tied for 2nd in her Masters, category, with Helen Knight also inside the top 10 Masters athletes – a great achievement for the CLC ladies once again.

Meanwhile, up in Lilleshall in a race hosted by Telford AC, the men slogged it out one more time across the country. __Will Ferguson__ led them home in a good top-10 finish in 8th. __Iain Porter__ ducked into the top 50 in 49th place as the next finisher, with __Dan Bazzard__ not far behind in 56th. Battling a niggling injury, __Tom Kabala__ toughed it out for 66th while the much-improved __Richard Symonds__ finished in the top 100 for the first time in 93rd and __Jon Howes__ bagged the sixth team scoring place in 96th

The faithful __Paul Lockyer__, who has raced every cross country fixture this season, finished in 118th, __Will Pearce__ bagged 122nd, Tom Fletcher finished in 159th, __Hedley Phillips__ in 183rd and __Andrew Gage__ in 187th.

On the day, CLC Striders finished in 11th in the team standings but they were 10th overall for the season, meaning they stay in Division 2. In the individual standings across all the fixtures, four CLC athletes finished in the top 50, with Will Ferguson achieving 7th place (without competing in all the races), Iain Porter finishing 36th, Tom Kabala 37th and Dan Bazzard 46th.
