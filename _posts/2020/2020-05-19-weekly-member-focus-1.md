Each week we are going to share an update on a member of the club and the activities they are undertaking to keep running during lockdown. This week we focus on our very own Strider of the Month, **Will Pearce**.

With Manchester Marathon being cancelled (as with all the others), Will decided he wanted to get something from all the training and had his own bash from home on the quiet roads of Benhall, doing enough loops to cover 42km - there was even a fuel station at home! Perfect weather, flat route and Will managed an unofficial PB of **2.55.43**.

Will noted that he could not have done it without being part of such a great club and great coaching! Big thanks went to our Head Coach, Brendan Ward, for a great training plan, as well as Will Ferguson and Chris Hale for all the training miles and motivation.

Will is now aiming for an official PB in Manchester 2021.....

Well done Will, keep up the amazing work and look forward to seeing you complete your next challenge.
