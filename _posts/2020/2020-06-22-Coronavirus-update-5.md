The committee continue to review the situation around Covid-19 to ensure the health and wellbeing of our members is maintained.

In line with Government and [England Athletics guidance](https://www.englandathletics.org/athletics-and-running/news/guidance-update-step-2/), CLC Striders plan to re-commence speed training sessions in groups of strictly no more than 6 people (maximum 24 total) from Wednesday 24 June. The sessions will take place in Pittville Park every Wednesday from 1830.
 
A [Covid-19 risk assessment](/assets/Covid-19-risk-assessment-2020-06-22.pdf "Covid-19 risk assessment")
 has been produced and made available to those attending training. Members attending speed training are asked to ensure they:
* Do not attend training if they have any Coronavirus symptoms, or have been in close contact with anyone else who has
* Wash their hands before attending training and when arriving home
* Keep at least 2 metres away from others at all times during training
* Listen to and follow the instructions of the coaches/leader

The speed training session will be undertaken in 4 groups of 6 at different locations around Pittville Park.
