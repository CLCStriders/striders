Following discussions over the weekend that were followed by further discussions between the Area Athletic Associations this morning it has been agreed that in advance of a Government Directive to ban all sporting fixtures or sporting fixtures above a certain size, the decision has been taken to cancel all three Area Road Relays.
The races affected are as follows:

1. The Midland Area Road Relay Championships due to be held in Sutton Park on Saturday 21st March 2020
2. The Northern Area Road Relay Championships due to be held in Birkenhead Park on Sunday 22nd March 2020.
3. The Southern Area Road Relay Championships due to be held in Milton Keynes on Sunday 22nd March 2020.

The fixture calendar is so congested that once fixtures are allowed to recommence it will probably be too late to reschedule these races and all three Associations hope that the Coronavirus pandemic will be under control to allow the Autumn Area and National Road Relays to be held as currently planned.
The situation with regard to the National Road Relays due to be held in Sutton Park on Saturday 4th April 2020 will be updated as soon as the Area Associations have been advised.
