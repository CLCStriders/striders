**Will Ferguson** made his debut over the full marathon distance on Sunday 28 April in London’s iconic event. It turned out to be quite a debut. Clocking 2:30:20, Will smashed the club’s record for the distance, finishing only just outside his ambitious target time of 2:30:00. Not only that, he finished 92<sup>nd</sup>, inside the top 100, an incredible achievement on his first outing over the gruelling distance.

Will reached the half way mark in 73.20, setting him up nicely for his 2:30:00 target. Despite slowing a little over the next 10k, he still reached&nbsp;the 30k mark in 1:44:39 – inside his target time.

Over the next 10k, however, Will started to cramp up, reaching 40k in 2:21:59. With just over 2k to go, he dug in deep, pushing through the pain, to finish in 2:30:20, just 21 seconds shy of what would have been an incredible achievement in an event which requires a few outings over the distance to gain the learning and experience, as well as physical endurance, in order to deliver your best performance.&nbsp;

Will’s London marathon time marked the culmination of a superb last 12 months of running for the athlete which have seen him set new PBs for the 800m,&nbsp;the Mile, 10k and Half Marathon distances.

Other club runners competing in the London Marathon on the day were: **Mark Fuller**, who clocked a solid PB time off metronomic pacing to finish in a sub-3-hour 2:58:06; **Sarah Wilson**, who knocked 40 minutes off her previous best to finish in 4:17:42; and distance debutante **Chris Thomas**, who had battled through illness in the latter part of his training period, to achieve 4:48:04 on the day.
