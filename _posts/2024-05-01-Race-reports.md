### Berkeley 10k - Sunday 28 April
 
On a change from the usual Monday evening fixture, Dursley Running club hosted their annual Berkeley 10k on a Sunday morning this year. A good field of runners – including nine CLC Stridrs – assembled for the two-lap course around the village, with its out and back from the old power station to start and finish. 
 
Max Harrison-Tosatto bagged third place overall in a great time of 33:25 as the first athlete home in a CLC Striders vest. Just outside his PB, this marked a statement of intent at the start of a year when Max hopes to go sub-33 minutes later in the season.
 
Next home, in his first race since the Manchester Marathon, was Richard Aarons, running well for 35th place and a time of 39:36. Having run together for much of the race, Joel Freeland sped past Paul Northup in the final finish to clock another sub-40 minute 10k in 
39:55, while Paul crossed the line just outside the magic 40-minute mark in 40:02, but as the first finisher in his VM55 age category.
 
In his first 10k for more than two years, Eoin McQuone ran a time of 44:26, while the evergreen David James clocked 46:16 for second place in his VM70 age category. Colin Uptonran a PB time of 46:39, with Mike Speke and Julia Rose completing the Striders finishers on the day in 50:32 and 52:21.
 
### First Gloucester AC Open track meet of the season
 
Sam Baylis continued his good form over the shorter distances with a first place in the 3k ‘B’ race over at the Blackbridge Track in Gloucester in a new PB time of 9:28 – marking a great start to his track season.
 
### Newport Marathon - Sunday 28 April
 
Hifsa O'Kelly turned her ankle on a discarded water bottle at around mile three of the Newport Marathon and so her goal from then on was just to finish – which she did in 4 hours 18 minutes and with a lot of guts and determination.
