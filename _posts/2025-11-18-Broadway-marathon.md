#### Broadway Trail Marathon and Half Marathon - Sunday 16 November 
 
Once again, Rich Elsworthy proved just how good he is on the trails by winning the gruelling Broadway Trail Marathon in an astonishing time of just 3:18:20, more than a minute and a half ahead of his nearest rival. 
 
Other Striders competing were Josh Davies, who finished in 15th place overall in a time of 4:09:35, and Tom Fletcher, just a day after busting a gut to score for the A Team in the Birmingham Cross Country League, in 17th place and a time of 4:13:46.
 
Gavin Jerman completed the Half Marathon distance on the day in a time of 2:17:32 for 4th place in his VM60 age category.
