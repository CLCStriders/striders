10 Striders (and 1 junior Strider) had a day out in Birmingham at the indoor athletics Grand Prix at the NIA. Everyone enjoyed the experience and it was good to see a number of top notch athletes in action including various World and Olympic champions. Highlight of the day was seeing Jenny Meadows breaking Kelly Holmes national record for 800m. Low point was the fire alarm going off in the pub just a few seconds after our lunch had arrived, causing us to abandon it! The Boots meal deal we had instead just didn't do the job! Dave Smeath
