With thousands competing in the race, there were a series of starts in separate waves, with waves allocated according to predicted finish times. Over-optimistic predictions on the part of some entrants made for congested routes, and the more honest competitors had their work cut out getting into a position where they could run at their ideal race pace.

Nonetheless, Team Striders worked their way through the field and ran well on this course which, at 6.3 â€“ 6.4 miles, showed up as slightly in excess of 10km on some GPS watches.

First home for the club and 38th woman overall was Hilary Mott who finished in an excellent time of 38:02. Next was John Sutherland who just beat the 40-minute mark in 39:56 and he was followed by Jo Wilkie who continued her run of good form in 41:09. 

Alice Johnston and Derek Tebbs both ran well to finish with the same time of 41:37, whilst Amanda Steer, JJ Willson and Pat Woods all had strong runs to finish well inside the 45 minute mark with times of 42:20, 42:45 and 43:20 respectively.

Next was Andrew Paterson who inched closer to beating 45 minutes with 45:20, whilst newcomer Kelsey Smith showed great promise with 45:22. Beckie Boulton followed soon after and completed the line-up in 50:51.
