### Cranham Boundary Chase / 5.6 miles / Saturday 7 September
 
On a damp and drizzly Saturday morning, two CLC Striders took to the undulating roads around the beautiful landscape of Cranham Woods just outside Cheltenham. Over a course of 5.6 miles, strong man Rob Green pulled a long way ahead of the rest of the field to win easily in a time of 32:14. This was Rob’s 4th win in the Gloucestershire Road Race Series for 2024 and it takes him 7 points clear at the top of the table, with just 3 races remaining. Richard Aarons also ran strongly to finish in 17th place overall in a time of 38:36.
 
### The Whitehorse 50k / Saturday 7 September
 
Meanwhile, slightly further away, club ultra specialist Rob Bircher was notching up yet another event by completing the Whitehorse 50k trail ultra in just over 7 hours. Comprising 31 miles of trails around Marlborough, its highlights included the stones at Avebury and one of the chalk white horses.
 
### Europa Trail, Brussels / Saturday 7 September
 
Even further from home, club newcomer Gavin Woods made his ultra debut in beautiful woodland just outside Brussels. He completed the course of just over 31 miles in just under 5 hours – which augers well for his future as an ultra competitor.
 
### Great North Run / Sunday 8 September 
 
Up in Newcastle, two CLC Striders lined up with the masses to run the iconic Great North half marathon. On the damp day, Kate Telford, star struck and inspired in the presence of Eilish McColgan ,came home in a new PB time of 1:26:16, and Adam Greenwood ran a solid 1:30:51, after struggling in the Cheltenham Half only a week before.
 
### Run Upcote / Sunday 8 September
 
And finally, up at Upcote Farm near Withington, 8 CLC Striders ran in this picturesque, friendly, local 5-mile trail event.
