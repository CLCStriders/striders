<span lang="EN">On a wet and windy Friday evening, Sophie Longmore headed along the Avon Gorge Towpath for the fourth and final GWR Towpath 2017 Series, a highly popular series of 10K events held in Bristol on Friday evenings between May and July.</span>

<span lang="EN">Taking place on a towpath that runs alongside the Avon Gorge and underneath the Clifton Suspension Bridge, the 10K out and back course, which is mainly downhill for the first half and mainly uphill on the return, includes a mixture of grass, tarmac and off-road path/ cycle track type surfaces which were wet and muddy in places.</span>

<span lang="EN">On her first outing of the course and second off road race, Sophie finished first lady and 34<sup>thÂ </sup>overall with a time of 43:15, winning a prized bottle of white wine. Just what is needed on a Friday evening!</span>
