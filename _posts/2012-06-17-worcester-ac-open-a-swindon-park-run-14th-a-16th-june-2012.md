What better way to spend a warm June summerâ€™s evening than a local track race?&#8230; Well, instead I paddled my way round a very wet and blustery 1500m at the Worcester Open Meeting on Thursday evening! All entrants were run in one race, a large field of 19 athletes in total. Youâ€™d think there would be someone to run with but the two men and one junior lady were too fast for me and in fact all the youngsters, were too erratically paced, going off like rockets for me to then have to pass them all back over the course of 3 and ¾ laps. Happy to finish in a time, quite close to my best, of 5:21.7, 1<sup>st</sup>as Senior lady, 2<sup>nd</sup>Female overall.

No picture Iâ€™m afraid as I donâ€™t own a waterproof camera!! Hoping for better conditions next time!

Swindon Park Run on Saturday morning was also windy so didnâ€™t expect a pb but it was at least dry and I came away with a victory as 1st Lady and 11<sup>th</sup>overall in a field of nearly 300. Again the time of 20:30 was not far from my best.
