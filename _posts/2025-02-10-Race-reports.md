The final cross-country weekend of the Birmingham League and Midland League proved to be a day of mixed fortunes for the CLC Striders Women’s and Men’s teams.

Both teams were just one place above their respective Division relegation zones, the men in Division 2 of the Birmingham League and the women contesting Division 1 of the Midland League.

With club pride at stake and both teams fielding strong runners, confidence of surviving a drop in either Division was high. 

First to run were the women, with a team of four.  Ellie Pudifoot, the debutant, ran exceptionally well to finish in a tied-time of 28:34 with Kate Telford in positions 47 and 48. Helen Knight followed closely in a time of 28:41 to finish in 50th. Rachel Vines, returning from injury, was the final scorer in a time of 30:51, 82nd out of 139 runners completing the two lap 6.5km course.

While the women pondered their fate and donned some warmer clothing, the men took to the line to race 3 laps and 10km.

The women’s results were quickly available and, despite a really good effort on the day, the team was leap-frogged by Leamington AC and relegated to Division 2. Any disappointment on the day was mixed with a steely determination to win promotion next season. 

The men’s results are not yet officially published, but the signs are good that their Division 2 status has been retained.  Rob Green was first home for Striders in 15th place in a time of 36:03, followed by Will Ferguson in 20th, Richard Elsworthy in 22nd, Rob Barnett in 40th, Iain Porter in 52nd and Jon Comer in 79th to complete the ‘A’ team scorers.

Other Strider finishers on the day were Tom Burgess in 102nd, Gavin Woods in 115th, Adam Greenwood in 124th, Rob Hyams in 129th, Liam Richardson in 130th, Richard Aarons in 161st and Gary Farquharson in 180th. (Tim Brock and Dan Bazzard both had to retire with niggles.)

** Footnote **
With more running planned for the weekend and very little time to recover, Ellie Pudifoot was first lady home the very next morning at the Westonbirt Arboretum 10K!
