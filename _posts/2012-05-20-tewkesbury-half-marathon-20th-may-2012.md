Jp who is normally a 5k and 10k specialist, decided to go up in distance and see what would happen. He remained strong throughout the race, and could certainly run faster if pushed. His time of 70.10 is excellent, and is a new CLC Striders Club record. Jon Howes also ran well to record 85.52, this is an encouraging run by Howes who is recovering from a recent chest infection.

Striders results:

1 John Parker 01:10:13

37 Jon Howes 01:26:00

106 Sophie Jones 01:33:31

252 Dave Mayo 01:42:51

352 Phillip Hodder 01:49:00

568 Nicola Christian 02:00:42
