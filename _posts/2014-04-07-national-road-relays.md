This event consists of teams of 6 ladies from many clubs across the country and sees top names such as Hannah England, Susan Partridge, Laura Weightman and Emelia Gorecka compete. Each leg was 4.135km.

Hilary Agate ran a storming first leg in 15:55, getting the team off to a great start in 28<sup>th</sup>place. Agate handed over to Jo Wilkie who demonstrated her super consistency by running 17:27, only a few seconds slower than her time in the Midland Road relays a few weeks ago. The ever improving Amanda Steer continued her string of amazing runs by gaining 2 places on the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg finishing in 17:26. Steer handed over to Vicky Veness who ran well in her first time at this event finishing in 18:23. Vicky Lewis ran a super quick 5 leg, gaining one place in a time of 17:37, and took a good chunk of the time she ran in the Midlands. The final leg was run by Rachel Vines who gained 1 place, finishing in a time of 17:49. 

The ladies finished 28<sup>th</sup>place out of 57 teams which is a great result for the club.
