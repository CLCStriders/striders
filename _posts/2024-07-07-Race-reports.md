### Frampton 10k, Monday 1 July 

The first day of July, and a dozen CLC Striders turned out for the popular Frampton 10K on a warm and overcast Monday evening. Three runners broke the 40-minute mark on the night – Sheng Peng with a storming 39:08 coming back after longterm injury, Will in 39:25 and Paul Northup in 39:40, achieving a new MV55 club record. Just the other side of the magic 40-minute mark, Jon Howes crossed the line in 40:23.
With track to come later in the week, Joel Freeland ran the 10k as a tempo run in 42:17, Tim Brock finished in a very well-paced 43:37, Nigel Bailey registered 45:11, and the evergreen David James was first MV70+ in a wonderful time of 46:44.

Completing the list of Striders finishers on the night were Adam Hockaday in 49:11, Mike Speke in 50:14, Julia Rose in 52:29 and Edward Collier in 53:25.
