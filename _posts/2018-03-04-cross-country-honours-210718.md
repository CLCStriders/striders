Karlien capped off a superb cross country season in February by leading the ladies team home in the Midland League meeting in Wolverhampton. And the strength of her performances, alongside those of her fellow ladies team members, resulted in the promotion of CLC Striders Ladies to Division 1 of the Midland League.

<span class="text_exposed_show">Karlien (aka The Gazelle) also led the ladies home in the Gloucestershire League Cross Country fixture at Pitville Park and collected a Bronze medal as third senior lady overall in the 2017/18 Glos League.</span>
