A small group of Striders competed in the County Championships last Saturday.   This year the event moved to a hilly and challenging course  at Old Down Park near Bristol, having previously been held for two consecutive years in the Forest of Dean,

The ladies were first to go, and the Striders acquitted themselves well on the tough terrain.  First back for the club and showing characteristic consistency was Rachel Vines who ran a gutsy race to finish in an excellent 9th place; Vines was followed by Amelia Mullins who ran well to claim 16th place.  Next in was Emma Abbey in an excellent 31st place, and Zoe Gough completed the line-up, running well to claim 39th place.

In the men's race, Chris Driskell finished in 23rd place; David James was next, running well to take 60th place, and Chris Thomas ran a strong race to finish in 66th place.
