The club had a total of 44 runners taking part which was a fantastic effort all round.  
The ladies race saw great packing with Hilary Mott finishing 10th, Laura Kent 16th and Liza Barry 17th. The three of them did well to bring the Striders ladies A team home in second spot.  
Vicky Lewis was leading runner in the B team finishing in 18th, Alice Johnston was 28th and Pat Woods just behind in 29th place. The three ladies clinched first B team place for the striders.  
The men were led home by the ever improving Rich Dare who finished 6th, Rich Evershed ran well for 15th, Dave Smeath was 41st, Rich Shardlow 57th, Veteran Charles Goodwin 66th and final A team scorer Jon Howes finishing 93rd place. The A team were 6th place on the day.  
May I just add that there was an amazing atmosphere created on the day, we had great support all around the park and this certainly helped us all have loads of fun.
