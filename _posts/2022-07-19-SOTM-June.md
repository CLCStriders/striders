Congratulations  to Sam Baylis who is our Strider of the Month for June 2022.

Sam has been training hard at club sessions on the CLC grass track over the last few months and showed excellent form racing on the track in June. 

At the Iffley Festival of Miles on the 4th June in Oxford, Sam ran a very strong 4:50.39 Mile. Sam then went on to race 1500m at the Gloucester Summer Open just a few days later with a brilliant time of 4:26.3.

Excellent running Sam, well done.
