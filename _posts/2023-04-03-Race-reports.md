The first weekend of April was a busy one for CLC Striders athletes, as they competed in a really wide range of different events, both near and far – further demonstrating the club’s inclusivity, diversity and endeavour.

#### Midlands Road Relays - Sutton Park, 1 April 2023

The CLC Striders ladies journeyed north of Birmingham to race in the iconic spring six-leg road relays with teams from all over the region. With a mixture of in-form experience, someone making their road debut for the club and those making a comeback, the team finished 22nd overall out of 61 teams and were the 19th A Team.

The team were: Amanda Steer, Rachel Vines, Kate Telford, Helen Knight, Anja Whelan and Sophie Longmore.

It was Anja Whelan’s road debut for the club and run of the day was from Kate Telford who gained five places on Leg Three and was in the top 20 fastest ‘long leg’ times on the day.

#### Anglo Celtic Plate 100km and 50km - South Lake Leisure Centre, Craigavon, N. Ireland, 2 April 2023

Over in Northern Ireland, the intrepid Liza Bradshaw went to support her brother and former CLC Strider Nick Barry (who was representing England in the Anglo Celtic Plate 100km) and decided to enter the 50km open herself. Running 5km laps (10 times), Liza finished as first lady and in third place overall, even enjoying the novelty of getting to 'break the tape' for the first time ever in an amazing time of 3 hours 44 minutes. That’s 31.3 miles in 3 hours, 44 mins – averaging 7:09 minutes per mile.

#### Cleevewold  - Postlip Hall, Sunday 2 April 2023

Closer to home, up on Cleeve Hill, Helen Knight, Fiona Brady-Miller and Amelia Mullins took part in the annual Cleevewold run. A tough and hilly 14-mile multi-terrain race hosted by Cheltenham Harriers, conditions were damp and grey on the day after what felt like days of rain. Despite taking a few wrong turns here on there on the course, all three ran well – with Helen Knight winning first lady overall and Fiona Brady-Miller finishing as second VF45.
