**Report**On Sunday 20th February Jon Gould entered the QX Short Course Duathlon near Reading. This was a 6k run followed by a 9k bike. Going into Transition Jon was 4 minutes up on 2nd place and dreaming of back to back wins but was caught in the last kilometer, but still remained strong to finish in a fabulous second place.
