Since joining Striders, Andrew has competed in many races for the club. In January, Andrew competed in the County Championships cross country at Blackbridge, the Linda Franks 5 mile road race and the 3rd Birmingham League fixture of the cross country season at Wyken Park in Coventry. He continues to improve race by race. Well done Andrew for getting stuck in!
