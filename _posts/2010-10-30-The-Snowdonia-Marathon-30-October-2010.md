<a name="_GoBack"></a>Torrential rain and hail storms greeted the 1600 competitors of the 28<sup>th</sup>Snowdonia Marathon which follows a demanding and spectacular route encirclingSnowdon. 2 CLC Striders lined up to take part in this notoriously tough road marathon (and both making their marathon debut!).</p> 

Having been plagued with injury throughout his training Barney Bamford ran an excellent race, completing in a time of 4:19.47. James Gibbs also ran a solid race crossing the line in 155<sup>th</sup>place in a time of 3:32.34. A great achievement for both striders!</p> 

This is a fantastic event, with a cracking atmosphere and local support along the route and comes highly recommended.
