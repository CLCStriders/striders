This included the Sandown Park 10k, a 2 lap race around the perimeter of the racecourse and past the parade ring and stables of this renown racing venue. Fortunately, the heavy rain of the preceding days relented, though there was a strong breeze which made fast times difficult for most.  
However, Helen Howes made light work of the testing conditions, recording a magnificent PB and breaking 47 minutes for the first time, including a determined sprint finish in front of the grandstand. Chris Driskell also ran well with a sub 37 minute performance and 12th place overall out of a field of nearly 300 runners, whilst Dave Smeath and Jon Howes both battled hard to finish in the top 20. Ladies captain Rachel Vines also came to lend her support.  
The Running Show itself had a number of interesting seminars on injury prevention, training methods, bare foot running, nutritional advice etc as well as the opportunity to buy various running gear and sample a ridiculous number of energy bars/gels/jellies!  
All in all, a good day out with good company and accompanied by the soundtrack of Erasureâ€™s greatest hitsâ€¦.hope to get a few more Striders along next year!
