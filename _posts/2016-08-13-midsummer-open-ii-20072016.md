The second of the midsummer open events saw another strong turnout for the Striders over a range of distances.

Where week 1 had opened with a 5000m event, week 2 of the open series opened with a couple of 3000m which included a number of Striders.

In the B race, Rachel Vines was the club's sole competitor with a time of 11:20.5.  Meanwhile, the B race saw 5 Striders competing.  JJ Willson showed great form to lead the club home in an excellent 11:25.6, and he was closely followed by Andrew Paterson who had another strong run to finish in 11:39.2.  Amelia Mullins, Gavin Jerman and Zoe Gough completed the line up with times of 12:06.6, 12:36.8 and 13:40.6.

With the action switching to the shorter distances, Will Ferguson improved on his time of the previous week to run an excellent 2:05.0, whilst in the B-race, Joel Freeland showed consistency to finish in a time of 2:18.4.  For the ladies, Karlien Heyrman ran well for a time of 2:41.7.

In other highlights - there were great runs for Javid Norat and Paul Lockyer in the 100m (13.9 and 13.0 respectively); some speedy performances in the 300m, including a 43.8 for Joel Freehand and a 59.4 for Amelia Mullins, who followed this up with an excellent 83.0 in the 400m.
