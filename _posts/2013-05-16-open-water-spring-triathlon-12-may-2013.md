&#8220;My first open water Sprint (Super) Triathlon was met with some trepidation, although my Aquathlon, just 4 days earlier gave me more confidence with the open water swim, particularly with it being in the same lake. With so much to think about and organise you just canâ€™t seem to get there early enough, and I had even registered the day before. But, I got everything into transition as I wanted it and was in the water on time and warmed up raring to go by the 5 min briefing.

A swim of just 400m with 100 competitors (all women go in the 1<sup>st</sup>wave) was a bit of a fight, but I picked a good line and despite not being as quick as I would have liked, came out the water in 30<sup>th</sup>. The wetsuit was coming off easily until the final stage of getting it over my ankle chip and as my transition was positioned in a puddle of mud I was struggling to keep my balance, so I had to sit down, in the mud, to wrench it off.

A late decision to ride my new bike despite only testing it on the turbo the night before proved a good decision (even if it did end up muddy after my transition!) and I quickly made up some places. Only a few people came past me, and every time I looked up I thought smugly to myself â€˜Iâ€™ll have you on the runâ€™ and I did! My bike was 25<sup>th</sup>fastest of the women and, as expected, I made up a number of places on the run, with the 6<sup>th</sup>fastest time amongst the women and finished 16<sup>th</sup>and 3<sup>rd</sup>in my age category. I was 134<sup>th</sup>out of all, including men, out of nearly 400 competitors. Overall a pleasing result with the knowledge that there are a number of areas that I can work on to improve, before my full, Olympic distance, Triathlon next month.&#8221;
