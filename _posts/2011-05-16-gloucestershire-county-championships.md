Joel, famed for his sprint finishes over the cross country season showed just how much speed he really does have with an impressive 26.3 sec showing in the 200m, thats just half a second slower than sprint specialist Nick O'neils Club record. 

**Here's video footage of his impressive effort:**</p> 

In the 800m Joel put himself forward for the &#8216;A'race and with a seriously quick first lap did a great job to hang on and clock a 2.14.9, over 5sec quicker than his last 800m.

Finally, with the lactis still flowing through the legs Joel attacked the 400m, he once again put himself forward in the &#8216;A'race and he blitzed around the track in a very brisk 57 sec dead. Dare devils club record looks to be in serious threat!!

An awesome improvement in just a few weeks and the times will only get quicker over the summer, with 57 sec 400m speed he has a great chance to get that 800m down to below 2.10.

Don't forget part 2 of the County Champs is on this Wednesday evening at the Prince of Wales stadium with the womens 3k and mens 5k!
