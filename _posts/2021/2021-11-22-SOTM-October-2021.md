Congratulations to David James who is our Strider of the Month for October 2021.

David continued his brilliant form throughout October with more excellent performances and club records.

On the 3rd October, David ran a blistering 44:37 at the Berkeley 10km for a new M70 Club Record, finishing 2nd in his category. David also had a great start to the XC season in the first race of the Gloucestershire League at Cirencester Park, finishing 1st V70 and 1st male in his race. 

David also recently smashed the road 5 mile M70-74 club record, running 35:11 at the Guy Fawkes 5, putting him 3rd V70 on the UK Rankings for 5 miles this year! Awesome.

Inspirational stuff as always David, well done.
