Congratulations to Matt Ashman who is our Strider of the Month for March 2021.

Matt, as Club Secretary, works tirelessly behind the scenes & has been integral for the successful restart of club training sessions in March. This involved putting together a Risk Assessment for Covid, in line with EA guidance, to ensure we could return safely, as well as developing the sign-up form we use each week to sign up for sessions. 
Matt is also the guy responsible for keeping our website up to date as well as the club's social media pages.

After a very long and frustrating lay off due to injury for the last year, it has been great to see Matt return to a bit of running over the last few weeks. We hope his recovery continues to go well & that he is able to return to club sessions soon.

Thanks again for all of your efforts Matt.
