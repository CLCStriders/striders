Please see interval session below, this week set by coach Brendan Ward.

1 mile easy warm up followed by dynamic mobility, drills and strides. Then:

* 4 x 3minutes - all off 90secs recovery (Run these @5secs per km faster than current 10km race pace)
* 10 minute Tempo run @ current 10 mile race pace (3 minutes rest/recovery after this)
* 4 x 90seconds run @3k race pace - all off 90secs recovery

Please adhere to the rules, only train if you feel fit & healthy and remember you CAN train together with 1 other person outside - so please reach out to other members/friends if you want some company.

Enjoy.
