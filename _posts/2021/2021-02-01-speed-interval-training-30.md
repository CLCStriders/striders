Please see interval session below, this week set by coach Joel Freeland.

1 mile easy warm up followed by dynamic mobility, drills and strides. Then:

* 3 x (3 x 3 minutes)

* 90 seconds walk/slow jog recoveries and 2.5 minutes walk recovery between each set.
* Advanced runners aim to increase the pace each set, from 10k pace for the 1st set, closer to 5k pace for the 3rd set.
* Intermediates to run all at 10k pace.

(27 minutes of effort in total)

1 mile easy cool down and stretch.

Please adhere to the rules, only train if you feel fit and well, and remember you CAN train with 1 other person outside - so please reach out to other members/friends if you want some company.

Enjoy.
