With the latest Govt announcement and restrictions, unfortunately club sessions won't be able to take place any time soon. 

However, a weekly session will continue to be set by one of our coaches, which will be posted at the beginning of the week on here, our website and also emailed out. 

This week session set by Brendan Ward is:

* 1 mile easy warm up, striders and stretches
* 2 x 2 minutes @5k pace
* 2 x 4 minutes @10k pace
* 2 x 8 minutes @10mile pace 

All off 90 seconds recovery between efforts - (28 minutes of effort in total).

Easy cool down jog and stretch to finish.

Please adhere to the rules, only train if you feel fit & healthy and remember you CAN train together with 1 other person outside - so please reach out to other members/friends if you want some company!

The Committee are also in the process of arranging some other activities/virtual events to keep us motivated and we will keep you posted on this.

Enjoy and Stay Safe!
