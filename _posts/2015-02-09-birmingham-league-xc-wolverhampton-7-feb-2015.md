CLC Striders ladies put in an excellent performance at Wolverhampton to finish third in Division Two and gain promotion to Division One of this very competitive league. The Striders ladies are the only Gloucestershire club to have ever gained promotion to this league which is an incredible feat.

Liza Barry had a storming run to lead the team home in 37th and was followed by the very consistent Jo Wilkie who was 48th. Final A team counter was club captain Rachel Vines who finished 66th place. Meanwhile Amanda Steer led the Striders B team home in 76th, Laura Gush followed in 83rd, and final B team counter was Rachel Burdick in 90th place. Amanda Pill was the sole Striders C team counter in 279th place.  
Next Saturday CLC Striders ladies hope to clinch the Gloucestershire League title for the 5th time in seven year at Tewkesbury to finish off what is most definitely the best season in the club&#8217;s seven year history.

Meanwhile the Striders men did not disappoint finishing 8th overall in the Birmingham League Division Two fixture also held at Wolverhampton. Will Ferguson led the team home in a fine 12th place, Strider find of the season, Iain Porter, ran well to finish 27th with third counter Jon Cooke following in 67th. Club Chairman elect, Chris Driskell, ran strongly to finish 71st. Veteran Phil Jowett finished 113th, and final A team counter was Jon Howes in 143rd place. This was a decent performance considering the men were missing four of their top runners. Other notable performances were had by Dave Mayo who led the B team home in 210th, just behind followed David James in 211th, final Strider to finish was Gordon Bendall in 229th spot. Apart from Cheltenham Harriers CLC Striders men were the next highest placed Gloucestershire club in this league. The Striders men also compete in the Gloucestershire league next week at Tewkesbury and hope to clinch the Bronze medal position.
