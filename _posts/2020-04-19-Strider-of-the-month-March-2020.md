Congratulations to Mat Benfield, who is our Strider of The Month for March 2020.

Mat has been with the club nearly a year now, a popular figure and regular at Club Runs. 

Mat also does a significant amount for parkrun as Volunteer Coordinator at KGV parkrun in Cheltenham and in 2019 ran 1000 miles for [Acorns Children's Hospice](https://www.acorns.org.uk/).

You will also know now that we have a fantastic new club website, which went live in March. This would not have been possible without the fantastic efforts and hard work put in by Mat (our webmaster!), to give it the refresh it needed and keeping it up to date with the latest news, results & photos.

The club are hugely grateful for this.

Thanks Mat and well done"
