Once again hosted by Spa Striders, the second fixture of the Midland League Cross Country season for the CLC Striders Ladies and Men’s teams took place across the testing terrain of Clopton Park in Stratford on Avon.

Liza was followed home by the dynamic duo of **Karlien Heyrman** and **Helen Knight**, this time only a second apart in 43<sup>rd</sup> and 44<sup>th</sup> place and 30:26 and 30:27 respectively. Fourth home for the team scorers was evergreen **Amelia Mullins** in 81<sup>st</sup>place and a time of 32:35. **Fiona Brady-Miller** finished in 90<sup>th</sup> place and **Rachel Vines** in 102<sup>nd</sup>.
