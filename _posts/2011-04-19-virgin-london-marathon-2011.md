It was a warm day for running but that didn&#8217;t stop a host of PBs and club records as 11 Striders did the club proud and nacked up the Kenyans on the streets of London on Sunday. Wayne &#8216;Marathon man&#8217;Usher was first home for the club, followd closely by GPS who smashed his target of 3 hours in his first marathon, coming home inside 2.54. Dave Smeath was next, banishing the demons of past marathons finishing well inside 3 hours. Rachel Vines led the women&#8217;s team home in 3.11. A big well done to Malc Smith who &#8216;hobbled round&#8217;, having only decided to run the day before when he was told he couldn&#8217;t defer at the Expo!
