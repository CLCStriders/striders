We held the club championships 200 metres and 800 metres tonight and it all turned out to be a bit of fun!! 

The 200&#8217;s were first and we had 3 heats with all ages/ranges of ability all trying to aspire on becoming CLC Striders kings and queens of the sprint.

Heat one was won by Nick the bolt o&#8217;Neil who ran a fine 25.76 uphill, and on grass well done sir!! Dodgy bren who was chief timekeeper only timed 5 of the 6 who finished this heat as he had a senior moment of panic, he missed out Paul Edwards time so Paul had to run again in heat three (not a good start by dodgy).

Heat two was won by Mickey the chip man who was invited by super strongman Burge to try out the club (Lee visits Mickey&#8217;s chippy on a daily basis)!!

Heat three was a success as dodgy managed to time Paul Edwards on this occasion, Paul was the winner of this heat &#8211; phew!!

The 800 metres was one big race with 14 taking part, the race was won by super Will who stormed to a 2.09.92 victory to brake Rich Dares recently set club record. Nina Oates was the first woman also setting a club women&#8217;s record of 2.47.29 seconds.

Keep it up guy&#8217;s, we had a lot of fun!!

Bren (the sacked timekeeper)!!
