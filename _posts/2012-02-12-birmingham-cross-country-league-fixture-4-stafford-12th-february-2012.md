CLC Striders men performed superbly in the final Birmingham Cross Country League Division 3 fixture of the 2011/12 season held at Stafford Common. The Striders Men finished in a creditable 3rd place which gained them promotion at the very first attempt to Division 2.

Leading the Striders home, on what can only be described as an ice age course, was Richard Evershed who finished in an excellent 4th place; Tom Stone was next man in 15th place, his highest league placing yet; Jamie Patterson followed in a fine 22nd spot, whilst Dave Smeath, who overtook three runners over the last 100 metres, finished 31st. The Striders 5th man was the ever-improving Jon Howes in 44th, and final A team scorer was veteran Charles Goodwin, who is on the comeback trail finishing in 46th place.

Other Striders who really dug in well to help the club gain promotion, were Deryl Slight who was 60th, Jo Maddocks 79th, Ben Anderson 87th, Paul Stonuary 123rd, and Duncan Kay who finished 180th.
