Both felt like fish-out-of-water as they listened to the pre race brief for the 750m open water course followed by 2 laps of lake 32 (4.6k). Wilkie put in a fantastic performance for her first OW swim, exiting T1 in an impressive 14:54 and 3rd lady; this despite an argument with her wetsuit requiring her to sit in the mud to wrestle it off. Johnston managed not to drown and left T1 in 17:15 after similarly coming a cropper with the whole wetsuit removal lark. Both ladies both put in solid performances on the run completing that event in 18:43 and 18:55 respectively. 

Overall they finished 3rd and 4th ladies with Wilkie in 17th place overall and Johnston 24th.

Johnston then made a classic faux pas whilst clearing her stuff from transition by walking off with someone else's wetsuit. Luckily the 17 stone 6'3&#8243; owner of Alice's new XL wetsuit spotted the mistake and chased her down in the car park.
