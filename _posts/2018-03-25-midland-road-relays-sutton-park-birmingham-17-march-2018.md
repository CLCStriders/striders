As the mini ‘Beast from the East’ bit back with snow and bitter winds, CLC Striders Ladies and Men lined up for the annual spring Midland Road Relays in Sutton Park, Birmingham, along side more than 4 or so other teams from all over the region.

The ladies race was a six-leg event, with two legs of 5.38 miles and then four of 5k over a closed-road loop. While the men’s event comprised 12 legs – four of 5.38 miles and then eight over the 5k loop.
