JJ Willson and David James both set club records at the last of the 2015 series of White Horse 5K races hosted by Severn AC at Sandhurst.<!--more-->

In a race that doubled as the Gloucestershire 5k Road County Championships, JJ and David recorded times of 19:07 and 22:10 respectively. JJ was 39th out of 84 and third MV55. David was 63rd overall. He was also first MV65.

The pair received medals, JJ the bronze in the MV55 category and David the gold in the MV60 category. The medals were presented by the Right Worshipful The Mayor of Gloucester, Cllr Sebastian Field. They also, of course, enjoyed the obligatory White Horse packet of biscuits!
