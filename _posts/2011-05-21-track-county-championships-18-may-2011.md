The three ladies were up first competing in the 3000m. Debutants on the track Rachael Elkins and Hilary Agate ran exceptionally well claiming the county gold and silver medals in times of 10:59.6 and 11:06.3 respectively. Rachel Vines completed the ladies contingent finishing in a very below par 12:07.6.

Next up were the men competing in the 5000m. Dave Smeath, having only raced two days before, had another sterling run finishing in 17:43.8. He was closely followed by Joel Freeland, who yet again sprinted his way home passing Chris Slade in the final lap after leading Joel for the majority of the race. Their times were 19.15.1 and 19.19.9.</p>
