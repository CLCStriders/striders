On a cold but calm early Sunday morning a clutch of CLC Striders lined up for the annual Linda Franks Road Race hosted by local club Almost Athletes. A great way to blow the Christmas cobwebs away, once again it proved a good road race benchmark at the start of the year.<figure id="attachment_3300" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3300" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Stand-out individual performance on the day came from the ever-improving **Tom Kabala**, who transferred his electric form across the country to the roads with a PB time of 28:16 and 7<sup>th </sup>place overall. Tom was followed home by **Will Pearce** in a very strong sub-30-minute PB time of 29:29 and **Clark Lawson** in a massive PB for him of 30:13.

But if it was the individual men who came home first, once again it was the Striders ladies who ran the best team race overall – bagging first ladies team place in the process. First home was **Rachael Cary** in a very swift 31:27 and she was followed home in a PB time of 32:05 by **Helen Knight** and **Karlien Heyrman** in a solid 32:13. **Rachael** was the 4<sup>th </sup>lady finisher overall and 2<sup>nd </sup>in her category, while **Helen** was 7<sup>th </sup>lady overall and **Karlien** 9<sup>th</sup>. With three finishers in the top 10 of the ladies race, CLC ran away with the ladies team competition.<figure id="attachment_3301" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3301" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Recovering vet **Paul Northup** came home in the top 50 in a time of 32:16, with fellow fellow vet **Tim Brock** smashing his PB by finishing in 34:45. **Gary Smith** continued to improve his form with a PB time of 34:55, and super-vet **Ed Collier** bagged 35:58 on the day.

**Helen Howes** finished in 37:01, **Mike Speke** in 38:03, **Nicola Weager** in 40:32, **Rebecca Reynolds** in 41:10, **Dave Mayo** in 41:08 and **Charlie Haward** in 41:30.

All in all, a good first outing on the roads for CLC Striders ahead of their own race this coming Sunday, The Staverton 10.
