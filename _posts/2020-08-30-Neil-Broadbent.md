CLC Striders is deeply saddened to hear that Neil Broadbent, a member of the Club since 2014, has recently passed away.

Neil was both lovely and incredibly friendly. He was an excellent runner who ran for the Club on a number of occasions, including the London Marathon twice with a debut PB of 3h03.

Neil regularly competed for CLC Striders at Cross Country events, always putting in a fantastic effort with a few 'A' team scoring finishes. He also ran a great 37.58 10k at Telford and held a 1h23 half marathon PB.

Neil will be sorely missed.
