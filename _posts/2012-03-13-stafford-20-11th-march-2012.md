Alice won 1st L35 and was placed 4th lady (95th overall) in the field of over 400. The course had been described as &#8216;undulating', and by the third of 3 laps of Staffordshire countryside the undulations definitely felt more like hills. Johnston's biggest fear on going into the race was the possibilty of having noone to talk to for over 2 hours. Fortunately she latched onto a fellow gas-bag and chatted happily round until 18 miles when she got a second wind completing the last 2 miles at

7 minute pace and finishing in 2:26:19, a club record.
