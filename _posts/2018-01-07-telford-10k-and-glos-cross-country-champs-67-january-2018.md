The Gloucestershire AAA Cross Country Championships were held on Saturday 6th January 2018 at Old Down Country Park and were hosted by Stroud AC. On a cold and grey afternoon, the CLC Ladies once again enjoyed huge success in the discipline – with just four runners bagging a haul of 10 medals between them.

Continuing her fine form from the autumn, **Karlien Heyrman** led the ladies home, finishing as the 2nd senior lady in a strong field. Meanwhile, **Patricia Sturgêss** was 2<sup>nd</sup> and **Helen Knight** 3<sup>rd</sup> in the LV35 category and **Amanda Steer** was 2<sup>nd</sup> lady in her LV45 category.

In the team competition, the lady Striders finished second in the Seniors, by just one point, and second in the Masters, demonstrating their class yet again.

Meanwhile, club talisman and new dad **Will Ferguson** smashed his previous 10k PB by 28 seconds at the rescheduled Telford 10k on Sunday 7th January, stopping the clock at 32 minutes dead and recording a chip time of 32:03 to finish 43rd in an incredibly fast field.

Closer to home, CLC stalwart **Martin Bick** completed his 100<sup>th</sup> Parkrun at the Cheltenham Parkrun event on Saturday 6<sup>th</sup> January, dressed as a dinosaur and donning the infamous Cape of 100!
