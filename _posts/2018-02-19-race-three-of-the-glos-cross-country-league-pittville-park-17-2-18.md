Continuing to blaze a trail for the club, the CLC Ladies had another strong team performance. Once again led home by their lead lady this season **Karlien Heyrman**, 17th overall and 6th senior lady in a time of 28:59, the race saw a welcome return to competition from cross country specialist Liza Barry, out so far this winter with a foot injury. **Liza Barry** finished in 20th place overall as the 7th senior lady in a time 29:13. Third and fourth ladies home for CLC on the day were **Helen Knight**, 23rd overall and 4th LV35 in 29:24, and **Patricia Surgess**, 27th overall and 6th LV35 in 30:02.

The next group of lady Striders home were **Nicola Weager**, 51st overall and 14th senior lady in 33:06, **Laura Fletcher**, 58th overall and 16th senior lady in 33:46, and **Natalie Burfitt**, 60th overall and 4th LV45 in 33:48.

**David James**, competing as the club’s only male vet 65 finished 70th overall as 3rd in his rarefied category in 35:05. **Emma Abbey** was 77th overall and 13th LV40 in 35:42, and **Jill Harsent** was 94th overall as 6th LV55 in a time of 37:59.

On the day, the ladies finished in 5th place in both the Senior and Masters races.

Next it was the turn of the men. With many runners unavailable, it was some of the club’s newer members who were able to shine.
