Race Day 2 of the Gloucestershire Cross Country League saw runners from all over the county descend on Old Down near Thornbury to slog it out over the muddy parkland there. After torrential rain in the preceding days the ground was churned up from the start and conditions deteriorated with each race, adding to the challenge!

CLC Striders men didn’t manage to put a full team out on this occasion, but the ladies more than made up for that.

First home in 12<sup>th</sup> place overall and as 1<sup>st</sup> LV35 was **Liza Bradshaw** in 33:34, cementing her autumn return to cross country in style. Only three places behind her in 15<sup>th</sup> was **Karlien Heyrman** in a time of 33:20. Three places behind her was **Helen Knight** in 18<sup>th</sup> place as 3<sup>rd</sup> LV40 in a time of 33:31. Making up the A-team scorers (all of whom finished in the top 50) on the day was **Amelia Mullins** in 45<sup>th</sup> place and a time of 36:36.

**Fiona Brady-Miller** and **Emma Abbey** also ran strongly for the club. And **David James**, competing as a super-vet MV65 finished 3<sup>rd</sup> in his category in a time of 36:01.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized">
