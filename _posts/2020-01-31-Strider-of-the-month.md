Fiona Brady-Miller wins Strider of the month for January 2020.

Fiona has not been a Strider for that long but has quickly proved to be an invaluable part of the team. She has been consistently attending training and races, particularly cross country and won a gold medal for her age category at the Glos XC County Champs in January as well as training hard for the London Marathon! Congratulations!
