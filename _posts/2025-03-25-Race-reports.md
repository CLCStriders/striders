It was a busy day of road racing for CLC Striders athletes on Sunday 16 March, with the club represented at the full marathon and half marathon distance.

Swapping his trail and ultras focus to run a road marathon, Rich Elsworthy executed a perfectly judged race in the Barcelona Marathon, gradually increasing his pace across the entire 26.2 miles to finish strongly in a great time of just 2:43:38. Closer to home, Jonathan Margetts debuted at the marathon distance in the Great Welsh Marathon event, again running according to his hopes and plan to complete the distance in a solid 3:12:34.

Over the shorter distance, Paul Northup ran very close to the club’s VM55 age category record to register a time of 1:27:06 in the Milton Keynes Half. While a crop of Striders took part in the iconic Bath Half Marathon – Morwenna Suleiman clocking a new PB time (by over 2 minutes!) of 1:42:38, Nikki Smith finishing 1st overall LV60 on the day, setting a new LV60 club record in a time of 1:45:03, Laura Daubney in 1:49:41, David Orme (also coordinating a team of runners raising money for a pancreatic cancer charity) in 1:52:08, and Ed Thompson in a time of 1:54:41.
