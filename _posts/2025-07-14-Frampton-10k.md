#### Frampton 10k - Monday 7 July 2025 

While not quite a staple of the Gloucestershire calendar, there's a special something about Frampton-on-Severn that brought 505 runners from 35 different clubs to Junction 13 of the M5. Perhaps it was the promise of a free Aston Manor Cider offered afterwards.

Among strong competition from local rivals Cheltenham & County Harriers, Stroud & District, and Severn AC, nine Striders raced on the evening, coming back with strong results.

Frampton is a lightly-undulating course, mostly on tarmac - making for extremely favourable conditions. Our runners outran the field as well as their sunburns. In the open category, Joe Willgoss (34:07), Pete Duffy (34:19), and Max Harrison-Tosatto (34:34) were the first home for the Striders - coming in at 7th, 8th, and 9th respectively. This was Max's first race after injury; what a way to bounce back!

Adam Greenwood (40:23) clocked in a strong time, just ahead of Kate Telford (40:35) who finished 5th in the Female category. Also in good form on the evening were Joel Freeland (46:21) and Morwenna Suleiman (46:30).

Colin Upton (50:13) placed himself comfortably in the top half of the V50 Category, while course veteran Edward Collier (55:16) rounded up the evening, having raced Frampton more times than any of us can remember.

CLC Striders placed as second men’s team, just behind Western Tempo. Well done to everyone who competed!
