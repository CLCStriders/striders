On Wednesday 26 June we will be holding a 5k time trial instead of the normal speed session. Meet at 6.30pm in the CLC Sports Centre as normal. Open to all, this is a fun event rather than a race and we&#8217;re planning a second time trial in September so you can compare your times. Track-based interval training continues on Fridays, 6.30-7.30pm at the Prince of Wales stadium (no session on Fri 28 June).&nbsp; Please bring Â£3 contribution towards the cost of track hire.&nbsp; Again, this is open to all members
