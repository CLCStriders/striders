Session for this week Striders, to do on the usual Wednesday evening or whenever you wish!

Warm Up (1 mile easy), dynamic stretches, drills & a few strides

2 SETS OF:
* 2 x 800m (~0.5 mile) @ 5k pace - 1 minute 30 walk/slow jog recovery
* 2 x 400m (~0.25 mile)@ 5k pace - 1 minute 30 walk/slow jog recovery
* 2 minute 30 recovery between sets
* Cool down jog and stretch

Specific endurance session as a sharpener for the 5k virtual club race. Active recovery is key, don't stand still.

It is far better to train by distance as above as you can reflect on your splits.

A stopwatch only version is:
* 2 x (2 x 3 minutes, 2 x 1.5 minutes) Recoveries as above 

Be sensible, train alone & keep your distance from others! Report back and let us know how it went!

Good luck all and stay safe.
