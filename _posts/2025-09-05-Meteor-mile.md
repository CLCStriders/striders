#### Meteor Mile 2025

Three Striders finished in under 5 minutes at the annual Meteor Mile race, which uses the Staverton Airport runway as its course.

Pete Duffy was third, and only 2 second behind the winner, in 4:42, Max Harrison-Tosatto was fifth in 4:50, and Isabel Brinsden, in the performance of the night (and possibly her lifetime) was eighth overall and first lady in an astonishing time of just 4:55 – obliterating the previous lady’s course record by over 15 seconds, and setting the fastest UK road mile time for a woman in 2025.

Next came a crop of Striders finishing well under the 6-minute mark – James Endicott in 5:28, Jamie Hartnoll in 5:34, and Joel Freeland in 5:47. Just outside the 6-minute barrier were Matt Ashman in 6:12 and Colin Upton in 6:33. The final two Striders to finish were Andrew Danson in 7:35 and super-vet David James in 7:41, placing him fifth in his MV75 category.
