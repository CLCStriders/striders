### Bourton 10k

On a beautiful February morning, runners from all over the region gathered in large numbers to take part in the iconic Bourton 10k in Bourton on the Water – a flat and fast local event hosted by Bourton Roadrunners which always attracts a strong field. Early frost and mist had eased and by the time the 10am start arrived, conditions were perfect for racing – still, sunny and chilly.

CLC Striders had no less than 25 members racing on the day, and here’s how they did…

First home was the club, and continuing his incredibly strong start to 2024, was Rob Green, who finished 5th overall in a lightening fast field and as 1st in his MV40 category in a time of 32:29, beating his own club age category record by almost 30 seconds.

Next home was the so-solid Joe Willgoss in 12th place overall and with a new PB time of 33:25 and Rob Barnett blasted to the finish, also in a new PB time of 34:06 for 18th place. Sam Baylis and Tom Burgess finished 10 seconds apart in 25th and 26th places in times of 35:03, a PB for Baylis, and 35:13 respectively, with John Comer completing the club’s top 50 finishers on the day with a PB time of 36:32 for 46th place.

Jon Howes made a great return to road competition after a long time out with injury with an 83rd place finish in 38:08, while Helen Knight continues to amaze, clocking a new PB time of 38:23 to finish as the 1st LV40, smash her own club age category record by 30 seconds and dip into the top 100 overall in 88th place. Richard Aarons and Alex Doherty finished neck-and-neck in the same time of 39:31 to complete the Striders who broke the 40-minute barrier on the day.

Next home were Aled Leaver in a new PB time of 40:25 and Paul Northup 40:26 and they were followed by a good crop of Striders ,all finishing within a minute of each other – Joel Freeland in 41:16, Liza Bradshaw in 41:35, Rachel Vines in 41:41, Nick Ledwold (running the 10k as part of his long Sunday marathon training run) in 41:41 and Gary Farquharson in 42:00 dead.

The trio of Nigel Bailey, Tim Brock and Rachael Cary finished within 5 seconds of each other in 42:55, a Pb for Bailey, 42:56 and 43:00 minutes respectively. And the other Striders to complete the 10k were Steph Parker in 45:31, Colin Upton in 47:51, Sam Howe in 48:48, Adam Hockaday in 49:16, and Tanya Evans in 54:27.
