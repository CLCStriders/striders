Ladies club captain, Rachel Vines was the sole CLC Strider to compete in the BMC regional 1500m race held at Tipton on Saturday 27 August. Conditions were very wet but luckily there was little wind. The race started with a quick pace and after 1 lap the race had strung out. Vines managed to stay just behind the pacer until 1200m when she gave a final surge finishing 2nd in the race in a time of 5:09.2 setting a new club record.
