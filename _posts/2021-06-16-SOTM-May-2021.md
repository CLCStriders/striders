Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ Rob Bircher who is our Strider of the Month for May 2021.

Rob has completed many impressive Ultras over the last year (35miles across the Exmoor coastline just last weekend!) despite the impact of Covid.

In May, in what he described as easily his toughest challenge to date, Rob completed a 56.5mile Ultra along the Southern Upland Way in Scotland, with over 24,000ft of climbing (inc. snow!).

He did this with his running friend Laura, finishing in 34th & 35th place overall. An incredible effort.

Well done Robâ€¦.look forward to seeing what you do nextâ€¦..
