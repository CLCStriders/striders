#### CLC Striders members represent England at the 2022 British and Irish Masters International XC, Santry Park, Dublin 

David James (M70) and Liza Bradshaw (W35) flew the flag for CLC Striders, representing England at the 2022 British and Irish Masters International XC last weekend in Santry Park, Dublin. 

Both were selected following strong performances in the selection race in Derby in October. The course was dry, flat, short (3.5M) and fast, much to our annoyance as we both prefer hills, mud, twists and tree routes to slow the track speedsters down. 

David raced first, scoring 4th for his team which came 4th.  

Liza was up next, finishing 2nd for the England W35 team, which sadly finished bottom of the pile â€“ incentive to go back next year! 

Happily both Men and Womens England teams finished in silver medal position overall. Overall it was an enjoyable experience and a big honour to wear a national vest, and run with some incredible athletes right up the age groups. For anyone interested in seeking qualification next year, the selection race is back at Markeaton Park (which we are happy to report packs a few punchy climbs into its 3-lap course!) on 14th October 2023.
