**Glos County XC League at Pitville Park 06 Feb 2010** **The Course The Races More Photo's of the race**

**Report**

CLC Striders had a very successful day at Pitville Park, which was the final fixture in the Gloucestershire XC league, the County XC Championships, and the first race CLC Striders have hosted (joint with Cheltenham Harriers and Almost Athletes). We had a brilliant turn out, fielding 13 women and 15 men.

In the Men?s race, Will Ferguson was crowned County Champion after beating Steve Milward from Gloucester by inches in one of the most exciting finishes the County Champs has ever witnessed. Close behind was Rich Dare, who finished in 10th place, and Ben Pedley, who finished 21st and was 2nd Junior Man, earning himself a silver medal. Chris Driskell, Chris ?GPS? Hale and Dave Billingham were the other scorers for the Men?s A team, bringing the senior men?s team home in third place on the day, and second county team overall in the Championships.

The Women had it all to run for, going into the race over 50 points clear in the League team competition. Laura Kent led them home in 7th place, followed by Liza Barry in 10th and new signing Hilary Agate in 12th. This not only guaranteed them the league gold, but with Rachel Vines also having a brilliant run to come home in 29th place, secured them the County Championship team gold as well. The ladies vet team also came third in the League. Individually, Laura Kent added League LV35 gold and County Champs LV35 silver to her haul of medals, Sylvia Koster was crowned County League LV60 Champion, Naomi Kellet won the County Championship LV40 silver and Liza Barry won the SL League Bronze and SL County Championship Bronze. 

Overall this has to be one of the most successful days in the club?s short history ? well done to everyone who ran, you have made Brendan very proud!

Finally, but most importantly of all, many Striders and their family and friends gave up their Saturday to help marshall/process results/set up the course. On behalf of the club and everyone who ran thank you very much ? the day simply wouldn?t have happened without you and given how cold it was running was definitely the easy job! Thanks also for the brilliant support on the course.
