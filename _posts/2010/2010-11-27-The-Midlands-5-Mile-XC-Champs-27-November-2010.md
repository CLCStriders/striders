**Midlands 5 mile Cross Country Championships (27 November 2010)**

 

**Report**

CLC Striders Lady's Team (pictured), did superbly well to win a Silver Medal at the Midlands 5 mile Cross Country Championships held at Wolverhamton on Saturday 27th November on a bitterly cold winters day.

Laura Kent and Liza Barry had a tussle throughout the race with both Athletes doing well to finish in 8th and 9th position. Rachel Vines followed running well for 17th place, final Team scorer was Patricia Woods who dug in well throughout the race and achieved a splendid 26th place. 

The Striders Lady's Team who are currently heading the Gloucestershire County Cross Country League will be competing in the Midlands Women's League next Saturday at Birmingham where they hope to put in another good performance.

Ben Pedley was the only Senior Man from the Striders to take part in the Men's 7 Mile race. Pedley ran a sensible race and worked his way through the field to finish in a very credible 40th place.
