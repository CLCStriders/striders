**The Berkeley 10km Road Race 10 May 2010** </p> 

**Report**

A Big Congratulations goes out to John Parker (JP) who has becomes the first person to run a sub 32 minute 10K from the Club. JP recorded an excellent 31.55 John Parker and Dave Billingham competed in the Berkeley 10K Monday 10th May. Parker ran a Magnificent race to finish 3rd and dip under the infamous 32 minute barrier to record a very brisk 31.55 smashing his own Club Record by a massive 46 seconds. Dave Billingham still recovering from the London Marathon finished in 26th Place and ran a respectable 38.26.

Well done chaps I am so glad that I took the night off to witness these great performances.  
Keep it up.  
Brendan
