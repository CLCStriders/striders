excerpt: "<p>Dawn Addinall represented the Striders in the Great North Run, finishing in 2:01:24, 10th in her age and gender group, and 12,547th overall. This is not quite as fast as Dawn's Tewkesbury time, but there's a lot more people to get passed at the start. Well done Auntie Dawn, another great result! I bet you're reallyt looking forward to the Cardiff half now, Brendan Ward (Club Chairman)</p>"
