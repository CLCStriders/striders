The 3000 metre womens race saw Rachel Vines running out of her skin to smash her own pb and set a women&#8217;s club record to boot, with Lisa Boyd also having a fine run to set a new lifetime best. Nina Oates unfortunately had to retire through injury. 

In the men&#8217;s 3000 metres Will ferguson ran well to set a new men&#8217;s club record running just outside nine minutes, in the same race both Rich Dare and Lee Burge also set new personal best times.

This was a great experience for us all, and saw every CLC Strider set a personal best time for there respective distances.
