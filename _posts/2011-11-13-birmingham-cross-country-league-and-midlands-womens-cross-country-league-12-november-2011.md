<p>Striders men make their debut in the Birmingham League and women run in the Midlands League at Leamington...</p>

CLC Striders Men made a fantastic debut in the Birmingham Cross Country League Division 3 held at Leamington. The team packed superbly well having six scorers in the top 40. Rich Evershed put in a fine performance to lead the men home in 2nd place, Men's club captain Rich Dare made a welcome return after injury to finish just behind Evershed in 3rd place, Tom Stone was next Strider and ran well to make the top 20; Stone finished in 19th place. 

Dave Smeath followed Stone and ran really well to clinch 25th place, Jamie Paterson ran strongly for 27th place, and final A team scorer was Chris Driskell who ran OK to finish in 40th place. The team finished in 2nd place behind Trentham RC, and with three fixtures remaining should make this league very interesting indeed, especially with promotion at stake. Other notable performances came from Jon Bird in 59th, Super Vet Glyn Bagnall 66th, and final team member Joel Freeland in 83rd place. 

Meanwhile the Women also had a good day with Jo Wilkie running well to lead the Ladies A team home finishing in 83rd place, Wilkie was followed by Veteran Amanda Steer who is improving race by race, Steer finished 94th, Alice Johnson followed Steer in 96th, Jess Straw returned to racing to finish 172nd, and Beckie Boulton was final team member finishing 231st place. Team positions have yet to be confirmed. 

We had a great day, and did ourselves proud.
