The course took in some fantastic coastal views with trips along both the Boscombe and Bournemouth Piers. An army of supporting friends and family lined the 26.2 mile route with many other Striders thinking of them from afar back home.

**Victoria Veness**finished her first marathon in 3:28:17 and was the 16th female out of the 584 ladies running and 9th in her age group.

**Charlotte Sugden**smashed her previous best of 4:16:26 (April 2014) with finishing in 3:40:12 and the 32nd female to cross the line.

**Rob Bircher**was another one to smash a personal best by improving on his previous best of 4 hours 5 minutes by finishing in 3 hours 28 minutes 22 seconds and was 38th in his age category (VM40).

**Andrew Paterson'**s first marathon also ended in success in beating his target of sub 4 hours with a finishing time of 3:51:54.

All of their results are fantastic and are a result of their hard work in training leading up to the race. All four were inseperable and were regularly seen on the streets of Cheltenham clocking up the miles in preparation of the race. Everyone at the club is really proud of their results.

Well done to the superb quartet.
