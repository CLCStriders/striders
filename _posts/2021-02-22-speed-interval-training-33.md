Please see interval session below, this week set by coach Joel Freeland.

1 mile easy warm up followed by dynamic mobility, drills and strides. Then:

* 4 x 1 mile @threshold effort off 90secs recovery
then
* 4 x 30secs @3k pace off 60secs recovery

Easy cool down jog and static stretch all the main muscles.

(You can use [Run Smart Project](https://runsmartproject.com/calculator/ "Run Smart Project") to work out your threshold effort pace, roughly 15secs per mile slower than 10k race pace)

Please adhere to the rules, only train if you feel fit & healthy and remember you CAN train together with 1 other person outside - so please reach out to other members/friends if you want some company.

Enjoy.
