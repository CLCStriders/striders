Interval session for this week, to do on the usual Wednesday evening or whenever you wish.

Set by coach **Brendan Ward**

Usual 1M warm up jog, dynamic stretches & strides. then:

* 10mins Tempo - run at 10-15 seconds per mile slower than your current 10k pace
* 5mins easy/jog (active recovery)
* 10mins Tempo - again run at 10-15 seconds per mile slower than current 10k pace
* 5mins easy/jog recovery

So 30 minutes total for the session, with 20mins of effort. 

Cool down and stretches at the end.

*Sustained tempo efforts are good for racing 10k and upwards.*

PLEASE TRAIN ALONE! Please, please be sensible, train by yourselves and keep your distance from others.

Let us know how you get on and we encourage seeing any selfies posted. 

Good luck all and stay safe and well.
