Another great turnout for the Gloucestershire league held at Plock Court on boggy thick slippery mud!!  
The women's team was led home by team captain Lisa Boyd who finished 33rd, closely followed by Anna Maughan who was 35th, only 4 seconds behind - and Angela Puffett completed the A team in a very respectable 40th place. Other strong performances came from Dawn Addinall who finished in 59th place, and Gerry Morris who finished in 69th place. The women's team finished 10th overall. 

Super captain Will Ferguson led the men home in a superb 3rd place, with Darren Milne making his cross country debut for the club finishing in an excellent 19th place. Other solid runs were had by Rob Shute 68th, Steve Elverd 69th, Chris Hale 81st, and James Gibbs in 85th, who completed the A team. Other notable performances came from Ian Daniels 91st, Billy Bradshaw 94th, Chris Slade 104th, Clive Hodges 120th, and Clive Scott in 127th. The men's team finished 5th overall, and the men's vets team finished 11th overall. 

Special thanks goes out to Gillian Stokes and Louise Allsop for helping me on the day, and to Steve Elverd for setting up his tent - much appreciated. Well done to you all for making this club so successful and for giving me so much pleasure!!
