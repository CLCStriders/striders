Rachel Vines had a great race in the Andy Reading 10km on Sunday.  Conditions were excellent on this flat and fast course, and Vines went on the attack from the outset covering the first mile in 06:08.  With the first 3km covered in under 12 minutes, Vines was always well on course for a sub 40-minute finish and came in as 2nd lady overall and 1st senior lady in a time of 39:52 to drop below the 40 minute mark for the first time since 2011.  Vines has been on outstanding form recently, and Sunday’s success follows a series of strong performances in cross-country races, and a sub 19 minute personal best for 5km. There were 361 finishers in this popular race which was won by Ian Kimpton of Luton in a time of 30:30.
