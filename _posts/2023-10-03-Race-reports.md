Once again, CLC Strider athletes were in action across a wide range of events this last Sunday. Although it was the beginning of October, record high temperatures meant conditions were unexpectedly tough.

#### Run Upcote – Five-Mile

Over the undulating and picturesque terrain at Upcote Farm (home of 2000 Trees Festival and The Barn At Upcote), eight Striders battled their way over this trail race, complete with challenging climbs, woodland tracks and exhilarating descents.

[Helen Knight](/images/2023/10/2023-10-03-Run-Upcote.jpg "Helen Knight") continued her unstoppable form, finishing 7th overall as first lady in a time of just 36:31. Eoin Mcquone was next home in a time of  42:33. The evergreen [David James](/images/2023/10/2023-10-03-Run-Upcote.jpg "David James") was not far behind as 1st in his MV70 category in a time of 43:11. Amelia Mullins clocked 43:50 for 3rd place in her FV50 category. Colin Upton finished in 46:11, Laura Daubney in 47:09, Rebecca Reynolds in 50:24 and Charlie Haward in 51:37.

#### Cardiff Half Marathon

Down in the Welsh capital, [Adam Greenwood](/images/2023/10/2023-10-03-Cardiff-half.jpg "Adam Greenwood") was representing CLC Striders in the Cardiff Half. Disappointed with his race on the day, Adam still finished well under the 90-minute barrier in his second fastest Half Marathon time of 88:42.

#### World Half Marathon Championships – Riga, Latvia

Meanwhile, much further afield, [Aled Leaver](/images/2023/10/2023-10-03-Aled-Leaver-Riga.jpg "Aled Leaver") ran in the iconic World Half Marathon Championships, clocking a solid PB time of 1:34:35 on the day.
