Charles Goodwin led the club home in the Chedworth 10 Mile Race.  Having run much of the race in a pack of four, Goodwin used his strength and experience to break away from the group in the latter stages of the race and finished in 6th place and 1st MV50 in an excellent time of 1:07:13.  Caroline Barnes was next in for the club finishing in 207th place in a time of 1:39:57, and she was followed by Jo Thomson in 264th place in a time of 1:55:04.
