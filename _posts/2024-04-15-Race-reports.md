### 5k Bristol Track Open - Odd Down, Bath
 
On a blustery and surprisingly chilly Saturday evening, a good crop if Striders journeyed south to compete in the annual 5K races hosted by Bristol track Club at Odd Down cycle track outside Bath.
 
Two CLC Strider men raced in the second wave on the evening (alongside the elite women) â€“ both running big PB times. In pretty much his first outing over the distance, Alex Johnston held back before unleashing an incredible finish to clock 16:15 as the 3rd MV35 in his wave, while Sam Baylis, in a rare road outing, was not far behind in a very strong 16:32.
 
Meanwhile, in the first wave on the evening no less than nine Striders competed. First home was the ever-competitive Helen Knight, clocking 18:45 as the 2nd VF40 finisher. Helen was followed home by Aled Leaver, running an impressive PB time of 19:10. Joel Freeland was next to finish, in 19:20 as the 5th VM40 and Paul Northup was just behind him in 19:21 as the 5th VM55 finisher.
 
Liza Bradshaw finished just outside the 20-minute mark in 20:09 as the 5th VF40, with Gary Farquharson just behind her in a time of 20:15. Rachel Vines ran 20:45 and VM70 super-vet David James ran well for a 3rd place in his age category and a time of 22:50, with Mike Speke finishing 4th in his MV60 category in a time of 23:46. 
 
### Manchester Marathon, Sunday 14 April
 
Ben Cooper and Richard Aarons made their marathon debuts at the Manchester Marathon. Both started out well, but as is often the case in a first marathon, found the last stages of the race hard. Ben held out for a time of 3:32:57 and Richard clocked 3:19:29. Also running was club member Sergio Anna Cano, finishing in 3:26:25.
 
### Kymin Dash, Sunday 14 April
