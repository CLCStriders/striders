### Gloucestershire Cross Country – Race Day One - Saturday 12 October 2024
#### Hosted by Yate and Sodbury Striders at Yate Outdoor Sports Complex

In the blink of an eye, attention switched from the roads to the country and the start of the cross-country season, with Race Day One of the Gloucestershire Cross Country League, hosted by Yate and Sodbury Striders across the fields around Yate Sports Complex. After all the September rain, the day was dry and the ground was actually not too bad – just a bit soft and muddy in places. The course was pretty flat and fast, all apart from a short, steep bank on each lap. But there were lots of switch-backs and twists and turns on the course which meant that athletes couldn’t really get into a solid rhythm.

First, it was the turn of the women, competing over a course of just under four miles. Once again, they were led home by the irrepressible Helen Knight who finished 15th lady overall overall and 2nd in her LV45 category in a time of 25:35. Helen was followed home by Liza Bradshaw in 23rd overall and 4th in her LV40 category in a time of 26:37. Steph Parker ran strongly after battling back from COVID to finish 39th overall and 3rd in her LV45 category and Amelia Mullins wasn’t far behind, finishing in 48th overall and 5th in her LV50 category. Representing the club for the first time at cross-country, Hifsa O’Kelly in 64th overall in the ladies’ race. All in all, a solid start to the season. Although official team results are yet to be posted, our own calculations place us as 7th in the Ladies Competition after Race Day One. 

Next, it was the men over a course of approximately five and a half miles. With many of their regulars away it was a chance for some club newcomers to shine, and they did just that. Standout performance was from cross-country debutant James Endicott who secured 50th spot as the 2nd MV45 in a time of 35:42. Next home was another club cross-country debutant, as Gavin Woods battled to earn 69th spot in a time of 37:18. 3rd and 4th finishers for the club were Richard Aarons in 76th place and Chris Driskell in 83rd place. Liam Richardson finished inside the top 100, too, in 87th place. Next, and finishing within a minute of each other, were Robert Hyams, Joel Freeland and Alex Doherty. Co-captain Dan Bazzard turned out to race despite no training for weeks to finish next (ensuring the men had two complete teams), with the remaining CLC Striders finishers on the day Eoin McQuone, Colin Upton and Andrew Danson.

Although official team results are yet to be posted, our own calculations place us as 11th A and 16th B Team in the Men’s Competition after Race Day One.

### Leeds Abbey Dash - Sunday 13 October 2024

Meanwhile, racing up in Leeds, Kate Telford smashed her previous 10k PB to register a stunning time of 38:13 in the Leeds Abbey Dash 10k event.

### Chicago Marathon - Sunday 13 October 2024

And on the other side of the pond, in the windy city (which, thankfully, was pretty calm, although quite muggy on the day), three CLC Striders took part in the iconic Chicago Marathon. Rob Barnett ran brilliantly to finish just seconds shy of his PB time in 2:42:55, Will Pearce, completing his third Marathon Major, ran a solid 3:04:43, and Nick Ledwold, just three weeks after completing his first Ironman in Italy, was pleased to clock 3:19:16.
