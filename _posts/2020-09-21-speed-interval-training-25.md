Here is the interval session for this week set by Coach Joel. Please note that if you are attending a club session on Wednesday the session may differ based on the coach's own preference and also suitability for the group.

Coaches will start their sessions no later than 1835 as we are fighting daylight - this will be the last session on grass.

1 mile warm up jog, dynamic stretches, drills and strides

The session:

* 4 x 6.5 - 7minutes, all off 1.5 - 2 minutes recovery

* 26 or 28 minutes of effort total (depending on group/ability), run at your Tempo/10mile pace

Minimum 1 mile cool down, jog and stretch

Hydrate well, maintain 2 metres distance from others and don't be a litter bug.
