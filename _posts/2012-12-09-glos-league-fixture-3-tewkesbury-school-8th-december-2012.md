The womenâ€™s race saw some exceptional performances. Despite the boggy tiring ground Liza Barry got stuck in from the start and her strength and determination lead to a 5th place position. Still somewhat a newcomer, Vicky Lewis worked her way through the field and finished a very strong 15th place. Prolific racer Trish Woods once again gritted her teeth to finish only 3 places behind Vicky achieving 18th. With a total score of 38 the womenâ€™s team finished 2nd team on the day and are placed 4th in the league after 3 fixtures. There were some very notable performances from the B team which consisted of Amanda Steer (24th), Amelia Mullins (37th) and Rebecca Boulton (57th). Jill Harsent ran well to finish in 73rd place.

Despite missing a number of key runners, Striders men put in a solid performance on the muddy and at at times extremely challenging Tewkesbury School course.  
With all 6 scorers finishing well inside the top half, the A Team finished in 6th place and now lie in 4th place overall with one fixture remaining.  
First back for the men's team was Chris Driskell who just missed out on a top 20 spot to finish in 21st place. Next back were Dave Smeath and Rich Shardlow who ran well to finish in 42nd and 49th respectively.  
They were followed by Jo Maddocks and Jon Howes who had strong runs in 71st and 73rd place respectively and the ever-improving JJ Willson who finished strongly to finish in 75th place.  
Adam Cary in 101st; Andrew Paterson in 137th and Duncan Kay in 165th completed the men's line-up.</p>
