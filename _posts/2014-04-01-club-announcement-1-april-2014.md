The move will make it much easier for club members to share a wider choice of training sessions; the club will be able to put on bigger races and field bigger and stronger teams in league events. A timescale has yet to be confirmed and there will be a transitional period while details are worked out. Other main benefits include: 

  * A change of name to Almost CLC Harriers
  * An all-new club vest in green, purple, yellow with black hoops on a white background.
