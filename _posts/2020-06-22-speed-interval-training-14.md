Here is this weeks speed session which the coaches will deliver on Wednesday at Pittville (if youâ€™ve booked your place) or you can choose to do it in your own. 

Warm up 1 mile jog followed by mobility/dynamic drills then:

* Set 1. 4 x 2 minute (5k pace) 
* Set 2. 4 x 4 minute (10k pace)
* Set 3. 4 x 1 minute 3k pace) 
* 1 mile cool down/stretches

All efforts will have 90 seconds walk recovery between and 3 minutes recovery between sets.

Happy running
