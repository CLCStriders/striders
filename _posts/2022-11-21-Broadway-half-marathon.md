#### CLC Striders members take part in the Broadway Trail Marathon and Half Marathon

On Sunday 20 November, seven Striders headed to Broadway to race along the Cotswold trails in the Broadway Marathon and Half Marathon. On a beautiful and crisp November morning, they set out over what was a very hilly, multi-terrain event, with had the added challenge of an extra hill this year (an additional 173m climb towards the finish!). 

Leading the Striders home over the marathon distance was the ever-impressive Helen Knight in a time of 3:57:35, finishing 11th overall and 3rd female in a near course record time. Next home was club stalwart Gavin Jerman in a strong 4:47:52 for 43rd place. He was followed by club coach Amelia Mullins in an excellent 5:13:11 in 71st position. Next to finish was club ultra-man Rob Bircher in 5:21:39 in 84th, closely followed by Rachael Sycamore in 5:24:35 for 90th place. 

In the half marathon, Joanna Thomson ran her first race since May 2019, finishing in 2:50:37 in 100th position, with her husband Simon crossing the line alongside her in an identical time.
