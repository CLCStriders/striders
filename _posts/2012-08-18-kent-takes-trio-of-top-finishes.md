Laura Kent ran in the Standish Woodland Chase on Sunday 12th August. This multi-terrain race starts off with a steep incline followed by 2 laps of undulating trails through woodland. It finishes racing down the steep hill the runners climb at the beginning. Laura had a good run, setting a pb over her time in 2007. Laura came 2nd lady (11th overall out of 105 runners) in a time of 68.47. The winning lady was Kate Goodhead in a time of 61.45!! Laura was the only runner representing Striders&#8230; we need more there next time! 

Over the previous couple of weeks Laura did 2 races and the boys did the junior races at one. The first was Crowden horseshoe in the pennines near Glossop. Both races were truly &#8216;fell&#8217;and they were great fun. Laura came in first lady at Crowden, beating the lady that had won it the previous two years. The boys had fun in their respective races here. 

Then the second race was Steel City Striders&#8221;The Salt Cellar&#8217;from Fairholmes car park in Derbyshire. This was a really exciting race where the runners were running through bracken and jumping streams and avoiding barbed wire! Laura led the whole way but had a lady right on her tail, and then on the last descent she passed her, but at least she put up a good fight!
