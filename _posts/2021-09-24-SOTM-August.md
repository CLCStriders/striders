Congratulations to Amelia Mullins who is our Strider of the Month for August.

Ameliaâ€™s commitment & dedication to the club is a key part of Striders success. Her organisation & communication with members on Training sessions is second to none, as well as being a fantastic Coach. Always so welcoming & encouraging.

Amelia also trains hard & keeps herself in great shape, regularly racing for the club and ran an excellent 47:38 on a tough course at the Bugatti 10k in August. More recently, she ran the Woodchester Park 8 mile trail race (over 1000ft elevation) and finished 1st lady vet 45

Well done Amelia and thanks from all the members for everything you do for the club. An Inspiration
