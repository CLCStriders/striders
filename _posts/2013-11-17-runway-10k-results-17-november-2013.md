In the absence of the winner from the previous two years, Severn ACâ€™s Harry Bishop set the pace from the outset and never looked like being caught, coming home in a time of 34:29.

The chasing pack included Andy Prophett and Dave Rantell of Cheltenham Harriers and Stridersâ€™ own Andrew Jones. Also in contention was Bishopâ€™s club-mate James Rose, and in the battle for podium finishes it was Rose who edged away from the group to follow Bishop home in second place, in a time of 34:29; ne was closely followed by Rantell who picked up third place and a new PB of 35:02.

Next home, and just out of the prizes was CLC Stridersâ€™ Andrew Jones who continued his run of fine form and rapid improvement with a massive PB of 35:11, an improvement of almost 3 minutes on the time he set in the 2012 Runway 10km.

For the other Striders who ran the race, there were PBs and prizes aplenty. Amanda Steer had an excellent run to take the prize for first lady in a time of 41:48, and there was also an award in the LV35-44 category for Amelia Mullins who ran an excellent time of 43:52.

Other strong Striders performances in the race came from Rich Cannock, who kicked off his marathon training with a top 20 finish and a time of 40.10; Victoria Veness, who continued to establish herself on the club scene with a strong time of 43:34; Gordon Bendall who claimed a PB of 47:41, Ali Gregory who set a PB of 50:59; Nathalie Lovekin who picked up a PB of 54:21, and Philip Hodder who claimed a seasonâ€™s best of 49:15 in the MV60 category.

Massive thanks should also go to all those from CLC Striders and beyond who helped out with marhshalling, lead and sweep biking, results coordination, time-keeping, entry-taking â€“ without them the race couldnâ€™t have gone ahead.
