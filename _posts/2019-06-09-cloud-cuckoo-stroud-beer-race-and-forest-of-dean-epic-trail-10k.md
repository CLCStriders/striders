**Cloud Cuckoo**  
**Wednesday 29 May 2019**

Cleeve Hill Common was the windswept setting for the annial Cleeve Cloud Cuckoo race on Wednesday 29 May. Five CLC Striders athletes competed on the night. The challenging and undulating course covers 5.5 miles on grass and gravel paths and includes the notoriously steep ascent from the Washpool.&nbsp;

A solid run by veteran **Amelia Mullins** saw her finish as second lady in 45:45, followed by a strong finish from **Ed Collier** as third MV60 in 47:30. The trio of **Nicola Weager**, **Rebecca Reynolds** and **Chris Thomas** ran the early miles together before finishing in 53:56, 54:48 and 55:13 respectively.<figure class="wp-block-image">
