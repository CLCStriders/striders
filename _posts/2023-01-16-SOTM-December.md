Congratulations to Sheng Peng who is our Strider of the Month for December 2022.

Sheng has been a regular at club sessions throughout December, training hard and coming back strong from recent injury. He continued his excellent cross country form with a cracking run at Pittville Park in Race 2 of the Birmingham League XC, finishing 108th and helping the Striders B team to 2nd on the day. 

Well done Sheng and sure we will see continued strong performances in the forthcoming cross country races.
