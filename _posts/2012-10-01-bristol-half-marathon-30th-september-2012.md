The cool autumnal air made conditions perfect for fast times and PBs. James Waller was the first strider home setting a quick time of 1:25:19. Waller was followed by Billy Bradshaw who put in a solid effort finishing in 1:33:19.

Lucy McNulty lead the women home in 1:35:47. 

Other notable perfomances came from Ben Anderson (1:36:24), Paul Bryant (1:43:25) and Duncan Kay (2:11:01) who all ran new PBs.
