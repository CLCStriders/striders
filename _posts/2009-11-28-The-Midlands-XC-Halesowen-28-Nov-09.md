**The Midlands Cross Country at Halesowen - 28 November 2009**

**<a name="Report"></a><a name="Report"></a>Report**

Four CLC Striders took part in the Midland 5, and Midland 7 Mile Cross Country Races held at Halesowen on Saturday 28th November 2009. The course was extremely tough with lots of mud/Hills to attack, and had a Very Difficult Stream to Cross on Every lap .Welcome to an old Style Cross Country Course.

The Women Started first and were led home in 7th Position by Liza Barry who seems to be establishing herself as a fine Athlete, Next for the Club in 12th Place Was Naomi Kellett who is improving with every race, She was followed Home by Rachel Vines who returned to form to finish in 13th Spot. This was frustrating for the Women as they only had Three Runners, and needed Four to Count in the Team Competition where they would of had a great chance of Winning. Still there's always next Year. _You only had to call me girls and I would of made up the Team of Four___The Men had Rich Dare as the Sole Representative for the Club in the Men's Race, Dare did really well to Finish 27th considering he fell in the First couple of miles and had to retrieve a lost Shoe which cost him Valuable Time.
