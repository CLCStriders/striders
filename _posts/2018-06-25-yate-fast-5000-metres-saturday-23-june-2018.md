**Will Ferguson **of CLC Striders set a new personal best time and club record at the Yate fast Track 5,000 metres on Saturday 23rd June 2018.

Ferguson ran in the final race of the evening and got stuck in right from the start, hitting each 400m of the twelve-and-a-half-lap race in 73-74 seconds. Reaching the bell in 14.08, Ferguson gave it his all on the final lap, running 67 seconds dead and stopping the clock in an excellent time of 15.15.09 to finish in sixth place in what was an elite field of runners.

Meanwhile, **Andrew Gage **– who, remarkably, ran the Great Wall of China marathon only a few weeks ago – and **Gareth Harries **put in excellent performances in earlier races, running 22.34 and 19.14 respectively.
