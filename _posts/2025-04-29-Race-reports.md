On a wonderfully warm and sunny Sunday, great for spectators but a challenge for runners, CLC Striders registered some scorching times across the country. 
The London marathon was clearly the event of the day. Will Pearce, competing for the 7th time, was first up The Mall for the club and over the line in a time of 3:01:46. He was followed by Paul Northup, suffering with cramp over the last six miles, for a time of 3:14:08. Helen Knight battled the heat, coming home in 3:21:18, and congratulations to Fiona Brady-Miller, with a new personal best time of 3:40:19.

Four Striders also ran the Manchester marathon. Adrian Montagu romped home in 2:49:18, a personal best. Tom Burgess, despite an injury-plagued training block, ran brilliantly on the day to finish in 2:56:17. Josh Hadland finished in 3:49:35 and Colin Upton, in 4:13:22, completed the finishers for the club.
Running as the sole Strider in the Stratford-upon-Avon marathon, Joe Willgoss, finished in 6th place overall in a scintillating 2:44:52. 

Competing in the Berkeley 10k, Pete Duffy, 4th overall, ran a superb time of 34:17. Also impressing, Isabel Brinsden blasted out a time of 37:00, finishing as second lady overall. Tim Brock, MV55, ran a personal best time of 41:05, continuing his excellent recent form. Also finishing were Gary Farquharson in 44:46 and, finally, pacing her sister perfectly, Kate Telford finished in 54:26

At the seasonâ€™s opening Gloucestershire Spring Open athletics meeting over at the Blackbridge Track in Gloucester, Rob Hyams and Rachel Vines ran in the 3000m. Official results are pending at the time of writing, but Rob came home in 10:38-ish and Rachel clocked a sub-12-minute time.
