Richard Dare Devil led CLC Striders men&#8217;s team to an impressive 3rd place in the Birmingham Cross Country league Division 3 race held at Nuneaton. Dare who is slowly returning to form stayed strong throughout the race to claim 4th place. He was followed home by Chris Driskell who finished 25<sup>th</sup>; Jamie Paterson followed Driskell and ran well for 26th place and Veteran Dave Billingham ran a great race to claim 33rd place. Meanwhile, Joel Freeland had his best cross country race to date: Freeland made up 20 places over the last 2 miles of the race to finish in 34<sup>th</sup>. Final A team scorer was Deryl Slight who put in a great performance to finish in 36<sup>th</sup>place. Super vet Glyn Bagnall was first B team scorer in a solid 85th spot, whilst Chris Hale had to call it a day to avoid further injury after sustaining a sprained ankle on one of the uneven sections of the course. The Striders men who are competing in this league for the first time in the clubs short history, are lying proud in an overall 3rd place, and with 3 teams going up, the club must finish in the first three to gain promotion to Division 2. This should be possible as the club had a few of its top athletes missing in this second of four fixtures.
