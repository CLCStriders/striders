For those runners who like a challenge the Cleeve Cloud Cuckoo race does not disappoint. Held over a 5.5 mile undulating and mixed terrain course, including two notably stern climbs, a gnarly downhill into the Washpool and a total of almost 800ft of ascent, stamina and strength is a must.

Pre-race talk was dominated by the question, “What shoes are best?!” often delivered with some anxiety. Truth be told, the going was good and anything other than slippers would have been fine.

Sixteen CLC Striders toed the line, led out by eventual winner Rob Green in a time of 33:50, hotly pursued by second place finisher Richard Elsworthy in 34:37. With Striders taking the top two spots the team prize was in the bag. Aled Lever lived up to his title of “most improved” by being third Strider home in 42:12, six positions later Gary Farquharson in 43:18 for second MV50 just holding off Jamie Hartnoll by eight seconds. 

A closer group of Striders followed, Nick Ledwold in 44:01, Paul Northup plus thirty seconds, Alex Doherty 44:34 and then first female Strider Fiona Brady-Miller in a strong time of 44:55, as first LV45 and third lady overall. Gavin Jerman, third MV60, strode over the finish in 48:20, followed by Amelia Mullins in 49:36 and Colin Upton in 51:51. 

Nicola Weager and Laura McEvoy in 53:23 and 54:15 were third and fourth senior ladies home and to complete the CLC Striders complement Rebecca Reynolds in 55:50 and Jill Harsent in 59:37.

Post-race talk was all about congratulations, back slaps exhaustion and smiles.

Respect to all those who could run and appreciate the sweeping panorama. Uninterrupted views of tens of miles across the Severn Vale made the race effort all the more worthwhile.

Thank you to Cheltenham Harriers for holding this annual event in such a stunning location.
