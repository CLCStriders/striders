After a week of almost constant rain, we could be forgiven for thinking we were in for a soggy time, but the sun shone, the temperature rose and the atmosphere was summery! Billed as a â€˜multi-terrain' race, the course took in the town, riverside paths and a couple of fields and was very scenic and well supported. Jo ran a solid 43:59 to finish 6th Senior Lady (62nd overall out of 564 finishers), with Amelia not too far behind in 46:53 (3rd Vet Lady 35-44 and 113rd overall). Manda and Sue came in together, achieving a creditable 1:06:30.
