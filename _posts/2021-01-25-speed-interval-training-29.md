Please see interval session below, this week set by coach Brendan Ward.

1 mile easy warm up followed by dynamic mobility, drills and strides. Then:

* 4 x 2 minutes @5k pace (all 90seconds recovery/rest)
* 10 minute Tempo @10mile pace (3 minutes recovery/rest)
* 4 x 2 minutes @5k pace (all 90seconds recovery/rest)
* (28minutes of effort total)

1 mile easy jog cool down and stretches to finish.

Please be CAREFUL out there with the Snow and cold weather, there are lots of icy patches around. If you don't think it is safe to do the session, just do an Easy run and wait for it to clear later in the week.

Please also adhere to the rules, only train if you feel fit & healthy and remember you CAN train together with 1 other person outside - so please reach out to other members/friends if you want some company. Don't forget to keep ticking off the activities for the club Bingo challenge too.

Enjoy.
