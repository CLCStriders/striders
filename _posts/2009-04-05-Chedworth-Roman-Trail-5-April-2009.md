**The Chedworth Roman Trail 05 April 2009**

**Report**</p> 

Darren Milne ran the 10-mile Chedworth Roman Trail on Sunday 5th April. Conditions were firm underfoot leading to fast times. Darren finished in 63min 07 seconds in 11th position out of 339 finishers. Darren was delighted with a time nearly 3 minutes faster than his last year. This is a fantastic run through woods, a river cross and through part of Stowell Park. 

It really is a good (but challening) run and Darren suggests we run it with club team next year!
