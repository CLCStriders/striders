#### Midland 4- and 6-leg Road Relays

The club sent teams to represent the club in the annual Midland Road Relays at Sutton Park, Birmingham, Saturday 20 September 2025.
 
The women’s masters team finished in 6th place overall on the day, with cracking runs from Kate Telford, Helen Knight, Liza Bradshaw and Sophie Longmore (saving the day to jog round as the 4th team member). Kate recorded the 8th fastest individual leg on the day.
 
The men’s team finished 66th overall out of almost 100 teams, with Tom Barlow, Jamie Hartnoll, Dan Bazzard, Oliver Wright-Jones, Tim Brock and James Endicott recording a slightly faster overall cumulative time than the CLC Striders team did in 2024.
 

#### Berlin Marathon - Sunday 21 September 2025
 
Rob Barnett opted to run a marathon major instead of the Cheltenham Half this year, registering a superb time of 2:44:40 despite battling really hot conditions on the day.
