**Last weekend saw a team of six ladies and 12 men from CLC Striders make the annual pilgrimage north to Sutton Park for the Midland Road Relay Championships.**

On a perfect spring day, teams from all over the Midlands converged on the beautiful grounds of Sutton Park, north of Birmingham for a long afternoon of team racing.

** **Once again the CLC ladies stormed a great performance, in 18<sup>th</sup> place overall, with the two long 5.3-mile stints – the first and third legs – run by Liza Barry, finishing in 18<sup>th</sup> place in a time of 35:46, and Rachel Vines in 23<sup>rd</sup> place with a time 36:12. The four 5K legs were covered by Rebecca Reynolds, who came home 25<sup>th</sup> in 24:23, Patricia Sturgess, 23<sup>rd</sup> in a time of 23:48, Amelia Mullins, finishing 21<sup>st</sup> in 21:40 and finally Karlien Heyrman, coming back stronger with each race, in 18<sup>th</sup> place in 21:33. The cumulative time for the ladies team was 2:43:22.

Meanwhile, the men’s team was led off on the four longer legs by Iain Porter, who bagged a 26<sup>th</sup> place finish in 30:33. He was followed by the club’s most consistent elite athlete, Will Ferguson, who gained an amazing nine places on his leg, completing the 5.3 miles in 28:59 in 17<sup>th</sup> position. In his first competitive race back after a long lay-off through injury, Sam Baylis finished in 23<sup>rd</sup> place with a time of 32:50. And the fourth long leg man was Greg Chilton, in 25<sup>th</sup> place and a time of 32:30.

With a strong platform built, the first four 5K-leg runners completed their runs as follows: Andrew Gage was 36<sup>th</sup> in 22:57, debutant James Gibbs was 35<sup>th </sup>in 20:58, Christopher Thomas was 42<sup>nd</sup> in 25:27 and Martin Bick was 43<sup>rd</sup> in 23:17. The last four 5K Striders men on the day were Paul Northup in 40<sup>th</sup> place with a time 19:47, Gareth Harries in 39<sup>th</sup> with 20:20, Tom Vickers in 37<sup>th</sup> in 20:06 and, finally, loyal club man and team organiser for the day, Chris Driskell, with a 35<sup>th</sup> place and a strong 19:00 time.

Overall, the men finished in a credible 33<sup>rd</sup> place out of 58 complete teams in a cumulative time of 4:56:44.

Elsewhere, CLC veterans JJ Willson ran the beautiful Coniston 14 in the Lake District underneath snow covered peaks and Charles Goodwin ran the Malaga Half in the soaring heat of southern Spain.
