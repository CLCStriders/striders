### Stroud Beer race – 3rd June 2024

On an overcast but muggy early June evening, seven CLC Striders journeyed to what feels like the top of the world to take part in the annual Stroud Beer Race. Hosted by Stroud AC, the race is so-called because all the runners get to enjoy a complimentary pint of ale from Stroud Brewery when they finish.

Consisting of three laps around Minchinhampton Common, the organisers bill the course as ‘undulating’ – a word that always concerns a roadrunner. More accurately, each lap of two-and-a-bit miles contains a short, sharp descent followed by what feels like almost two miles of continuous ascent – mostly gradual, but with a couple of steeper sections.

Fresh from his victory at the Cleeve Cloud Cuckoo only five days earlier, club talisman Rob Green went out hard and held on through sheer grit and determination to win the day in an amazing time of 39:10. Next Strider home, not quite as hot on Green’s heels as he was at the Cleeve Cloud Cuckoo, was ultra and trail specialist Rich Elsworthy, finishing in 4th place overall in a time of 40:30. Once again, the club were brilliantly represented at the very top of the field in a local event.

Next to finish were a crop of Striders all completing the course between 47 and 49 and a half minutes. Kate Telford ran brilliantly to smash her previous best on the course and finish as second lady and 26th overall in a time of 47:05. James Endicott was only just behind Telford in 47:15 for 28th place. Making his club debut, Josh Davies was 33rd in a time of 48:02 and Paul Northup was 45th in a time of 49:24.
Last but not least the age-defying David James showed his strength to finish inside the first 100 overall in 85th place and a time of 55:52 to win his MV70 category on the night.
All in all, another great evening’s racing at a great local event for CLC Striders.

### Fairford 10k – 9th June 2024

Sunday saw another popular, local road race – the Fairford 10k. By no means the flattest or fastest of courses, the event sees runners loop clockwise out to the north of the village through quiet country lanes before returning to the centre, but only after some fairly challenging inclines.

Four CLC Striders lined up alongside 400 or so runners from all over the region, with the first three finishing within a minute of each other – all under the magic 40-minute barrier. First home was new club co-Captain Adam Greenwood in 33rd place overall and a solid sub-40 time of 39:09. Only 11 seconds later, retiring Captain Will Pearce bagged 35th spot in a time of 39:20. The third Strider home was Richard Aarons, 43rd overall in a time of 39:48 and the fourth Strider to finish was the recently-joined Andrew Danson in a time of 49:01.
