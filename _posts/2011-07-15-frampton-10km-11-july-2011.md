The indefatigable Amanda Steer was the star of the show with a PB of 43.37, showing great determination having taken part in a 6 hour sailing race only 2 days before. Chris Hale also impressed, leading the Striders home with a solid 37.00 and second V40. Dave Smeath struggled, finishing in a disappointing 38.06, whilst Steve Callinan used the race as a training run as part of his preparation for the Berlin marathon in September. Trudy Jones completed the finishers with a respectable effort of 52.02. Frampton resident Lucy McNulty also trotted around but several unfortunate cramping episodes prevented her from completing the course.
