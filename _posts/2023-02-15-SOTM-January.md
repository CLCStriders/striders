Congratulations to Joe Willgoess who is our Strider of the Month for January 2023. Joe recently joined us from Western Tempo and has already made a huge impact.

Joe has become a regular at Wednesday training, as well as representing the club at local races and XC fixtures.

Joe achieved a super-fast PB time of 26:52 over 5 miles in his first road race in a Striders vest at Linda Franks, finishing 4th overall and first Strider home.

In Race 1 of the Birmingham League he finished 30th, in Race 2 he finished 42nd; he was 30th in Race 3 and 25th in Race 4 on the challenging Burton Dassett course. At each event Joe scored strongly for the A-Team, finishing 25th overall for the season and helped ensure the menâ€™s team success in promotion to Division One - for the first time ever.

Well done Joe, sure we will see continued strong performances in forthcoming races. One thing for sure, you certainly look better in green and black.
