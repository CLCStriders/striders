Congratulations to James Oram who has been awarded the &#8216;Strider of the Month' for February 2016.

The &#8220;Oram Express&#8221; won an individual V40 medal in the Gloucestershire Cross Country League. James was also a regular points scorer in the Striders' Men's A-team in both the Gloucestershire and Birmingham Cross Country Leagues.

During the month, James also ran a huge PB of 34:09 at Bourton-on-the-Water 10k, going nearlyÂ 30 seconds faster than the previous year.

Well done from everyone at the club.
