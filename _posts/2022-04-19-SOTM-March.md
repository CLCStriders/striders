Congratulations to Tom Burgess who is our Strider of the Month for March 2022.

Following a very strong end to the XC season and a fantastic PB at the Bourton 10k, Tom continued his fine form into March. A regular at training, with a few big ‘Triple Sessions’ on a Wednesday evening totally 20 miles plus. Tom is also a regular at parkrun, often helping with monthly pacing duties. 

This hard training led to Tom having a brilliant race at the Fission Half Marathon in Berkeley on March 19th. In tough windy conditions, he finished 4th overall in a time of 1:15:43 - superb.

Well done Tom and plenty more to come for sure.
