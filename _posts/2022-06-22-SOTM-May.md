Congratulations to Domenico Geracitano who is our Strider of the Month for May 2022.

Domenico has recently joined Striders, returning to running having made an incredible recovery from being seriously ill with Covid. Domenico has been at Wednesday speed sessions consistently over the last couple of months which has resulted in him running not one, but 3 Pittville Parkrun PBâ€™s in a row in May, with a fastest time of 24:21 & age grade of 62.56%

Well done Domenico, fantastic work
