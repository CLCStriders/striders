In the summer months, we revert to the summer Monday evening training routes. **We normally leave it a week after the clocks change** to make sure there is enough light, and to let the footpaths dry out, but it should be fairly dry given the recent weather. A final decision about when we switch will be made on Monday 1 April, but as a reminder these are the summer routes:  
[4-mile route](https://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=6584237﻿)  
[6-mile route](https://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=6584229﻿)  
We still meet at 6.30pm at the CLC Sports Centre as usual.
