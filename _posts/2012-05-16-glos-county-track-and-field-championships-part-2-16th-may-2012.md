Rachel Elkins Won the County 3k Track Gold at the Prince of wales stadium on Wednesday 16th May. The Striders Ladies had a clean sweep with Rachel Vines finishing in Silver medal position, and Jo Wilkie took the Bronze medal. This was pretty amazing as Elkins and Wilkie had run marathons only 3 weeks ago.

Rich Dare took a well deserved Silver in the Mens 5k, Chris Driskell finished in 4th place, and smashed his lifetime best for the distance by 20 seconds. Dave Smeath hung on well and finished in 6th place, and Ben Anderson who was making his track debut, had an encouraging run to finish in 9th place.

1) Rachael Elkins - 11.13.5
