On a bright and breezy afternoon last weekend, CLC athletes competed in the second fixture of the Gloucestershire Cross Country League. Held for the first time in the beautiful grounds of Charlton Park in the south east of the county, Chippenham Harriers played host to the meeting. The going was good, but muddy in places â€“ perfect conditions for a testing cross country race.
