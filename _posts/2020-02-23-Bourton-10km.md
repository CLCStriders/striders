The iconic local 10k race saw a fantastic turnout from CLC Striders, with 23 runners from the club competing on the day. Conditions were testing to say the least, with gale force winds and torrential rain to contend with on the long return back into Bourton village. Despite that, Striders acquitted themselves well on the day, with many earning themselves hard-fought new PBs.

First home in 23rd place was **Dan Bazzard** in a superb and speedy time of 36:10.3. Next home, in 27th place, was **Will Pearce**, coming close to his PB in a time of 37:01.7 and setting out his stall as part of his marathon training for this spring. V40 runner **Jon Howes** completed three CLC athletes in the top 50, in 46th place overall and a time of 38:13.7.

First CLC lady home on the day was the in-form **Liza Bradshaw** who set a new PB of 39:15.1 in 67th place as 3rd lady overall on the day – a stunning achievement. **Helen Knight** was next home in 40:18.9 to earn herself a new PB, 2nd place in her V40 category and a new CLC club record. **Rachael Cary** battled through to a time of 40:39.9 and 1st place in her V35 category.

**Nick Ledwold** ran a superb PB time of 40:50.2, finishing just ahead of **Rachel Vines** who clocked 40:54.5 as the 2nd lady in her V35 category. **Karlien Heyrman** ran 41:51.2 and **Matt Ashman** ducked just under the 43-minute mark for a PB time of 42:57.6. **James Babbage** finished in a time of 43:18.0.

Two CLC vets did themselves and the club proud – **Amanda Steer** finishing 1st in her V50 category in a time of 43:26.7 and **John Willson** finishing 3rd in his V60 category in a time of 43:42.9.

The other CLC finishers on the day were **Amelia Mullins** in 44:20.9, **Gary Smith** in 44:57.3, **Ed Collier** in 45:31.7, **Ed Thompson** in 45:41.0, **Joel Freeland** in 45:58.6, **Bradley Coates** in 48:07.2, **Laura Daubney** in a PB time of 48:47.7, **Mike Speke** in 49:03.2, **Fiona Brady-Miller** in 49:28.5 and **Sarah Wilson** in a new PB time of 50:56.3.
