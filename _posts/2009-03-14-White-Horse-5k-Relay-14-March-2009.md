Lisa Boyd Ladies club captain, continued her improvement recording a brisk 21.18 leading the team to an impressive third place to take the Bronze medals in the Gloucestershire team relay championships 

Nathan Jones (the special one) ran a supurb 17 minute flat to record the fastest time by a CLC Strider today at the White Horse relays. Nathan is now coming in to form just at the right time ready for a pb attempt in the Reading half marathon. 

We had a great turnout today, including Tom Thorneycroft actually turning up to a real race, although he arrived after the first leg runners were finishing!

Thanks again for your efforts and support - another great day

Kindest Regards.

Bren
