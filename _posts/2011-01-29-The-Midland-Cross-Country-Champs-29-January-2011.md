**Report**

Will Ferguson from CLC Strtiders had a storming run at the Midland Cross Country Championships held on a very tough Leamington course. Ferguson worked his way through this high quality field to finish in an excellent 21st place as the sole Striders Men&#8217;s competitor. Fergusons next race is on Saturday where he competes for his university at the Bucs champs held at Birmingham. 

Rachel Vines was the leading CLC lady finishing in 73rd place with Jo Wilkie on the comeback trail finishing in a solid 119th and Amanda Steer doing well to finish 121st in a high class Women&#8217;s field.
