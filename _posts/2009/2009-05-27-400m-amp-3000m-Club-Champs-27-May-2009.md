**The 400m & 3000m Club Champs 27 May 2009**

**Report**

We held the club championships 400 metres and 3000 metres tonight. Super Will Ferguson dominated the evening winning both the 400 metres and the 3000 metres, running very respectable times considering the track is grass, uphill and it was drizzly with wind against on the second 200 metres of each lap. 

Ben Hodges only 15, ran very well to dip under the 60 second barrier in the 400 metres. Sarah Greef was the woman's 400 metre winner, and Liza Barry was the woman's 3000 metre winner.

The 400's were first and we had 2 heats. Heat one was won by Super Will Ferguson setting a new SM club record, closely followed byRich the Dare Devil in 57.11 and Nick the Bolt in 59.39, Ben Hodges set a new U17 club record with a great sub 60 time of 59.57, and James Gibbs had a fine run to complete it in 61.22. Heat two was won by Simon Dee in 68.11 setting a new v40 club record, closely followed by Rob Lynch, with Sarah Greef setting a new women's club record in 80.29 closely followed home by Liza Barry in 83.58. 

The 3000 metres was one race with 9 taking part, the race was won by super Will who stormed to a 9.51.76 victory. Liza Barry was the first woman home in 12.37.64.

Keep it up guy's!!
