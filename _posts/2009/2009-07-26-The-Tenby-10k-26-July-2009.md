excerpt: "<p>Justine Hale ran the Tenby 10k in torrential rain on a very hilly course in an excellent 54mins 35 (approx), especially as Justine hadn't run for 6 weeks. Chris Hale aka GPS, finished in sub 40 mins - 39mins 43secs (unofficial), 27th (over 200 runners). GPS was very happy to break 40min on this very difficult course.</p>"
