CLC Striders had 7 Runners Competing in the Beacon 10k on Sunday 6th September 2009. This is an undulating course held over a very scenic route and is one single loop.

Will Ferguson (Super), had a Great Tussle with Midlands Steeple Chase Champion Steve Milward from Gloucester AC, loosing the race by two seconds to record a club record time of 33.06. Next home for the striders was Dave Billingham who had a solid run to record a time of 38.24 to set a new club V40 record, strong man Burge was next home recording a time of 40.27, he was closely followed by Nina Oates and Liza Barry who had an epic battle, with Nina just winning by a single second to set a new Woman's club record of 40.55. Next home for the Striders was Simon Dee who recorded a Big V40 PB of 42.32, the striders final runner to finish was Sylvia Koster who ran superb to set a new FV60 club record of 52.31.

Four Striders won individual Prizes which was a great result for the club. Well done, you have brought me some joy from your excellent performances.
