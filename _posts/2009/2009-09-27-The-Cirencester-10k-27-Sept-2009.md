**Report**</p> 

Nathan Jones led the Club home with a fine run recording a swift 35.45 in the Cirencester 10k, next in for the Club was Rich Dare in a solid 36.31, he was followed by Chris GPS Hale who had the run of the day smashing his PB and setting a new V40 Men's Club Record to boot with a time of 38.03. 

The Women were led home by the very consistent Liza Barry who ran 42.07, next in for the Women was new signing Naomi Kellett who on her first outing for the Club set a new FV40 time of 42.48. Other Record Breakers were Amelia Mullins who set a new FV35 Record running a very respectable 48.57.

The Club in total had 21 competitors which is an excellent turn out indeed.
