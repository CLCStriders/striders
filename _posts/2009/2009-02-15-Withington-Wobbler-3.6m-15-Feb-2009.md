**The Withington Wobbler 3.6m 15 February 2009**

**Report**

19 CLC Striders headed off to Withington to test a 3.6 mile road course out as the club may be holding a race in the village later on this year.

Dodgy Bren devised another one of his very dodgy handicaps and sent each runner of at various times. The course which was two laps was hilly, very fast in parts, with a downhill finish.

There were some highlights during the run, Tracey and Sylvia went AWOL and were found an hour + later heading totally in the wrong direction, Super Will eventually found them thankfully safe and well!! Darren the tornado Milne proved that living in the village is a big advantage as his superb time proved; he was only 26 seconds behind super!! 

Lisa super vet Boyd also had a solid run producing the 8th fastest time of the day (overall,) however Rachel DJ vines was the overall winner of the handicap race.

Well done guys and thanks for giving up your time to test the course out!! See you at training tomorrow evening.

Kindest regards.

Bren
