Firmly back in the Gloucestershire Road Race Series, CLC Striders’ annual 10-mile road race drew a sell-out crop of runners of all abilities from all over the region. And so, 250 entrants lined up on a mild and calm late January morning to take on the 10-mile challenge.

Using the Aviator Inn at Staverton Airport as its base, the race is a two-lap event out and back around Churchdown village from the airport. 

The race was won in an astonishing, course-breaking time of 49:29 on the day by RAF athlete __James Bellward__, fresh from his victory in the Linda Franks 5-mile race the weekend before. James led from start to finish, running the whole race effectively on his own – a master-class in distance running and a privilege for all those there to witness.

In his wake, Cheltenham Harriers’ __Alex Lee__ ran a new PB time of 52:05 in second place, and his club mate __Ben Price__, working back from injury, clocked 52:49 for third.

The first lady home on the day was __Kate Le-Chevalier__ of Pershore Plum Plodders in 1:04:31. She was followed home a minute later by the ever-reliable __Shona Crombie-Hicks__ of Tewkesbury AC in 1:05:27, and then, two minutes later in third place, by __Fiona Blackmore__ of Bitten Road Runners in 1:07:52.

The only CLC competitor on the day was __Andrew Gage__, who finished third in his MV60 category in a PB time of 1:13:46 in 71st place overall.

The feedback after the race – both at the event and on social media – has been overwhelmingly positive, with runners describing the event as a combination of well organised and friendly. Competitors were particularly complimentary about the encouraging and helpful attitude of the all the marshals.

Race Director Eoin McQuone said he was “pleased and proud that CLC Striders had once again delivered a well-organised, highly competitive and inclusive event.”
