Congratulations to Alex Johnston and Nick Ledwold who are our Strider(s) of the Month for February 2023.

Alex traveled to Barcelona to race in the half marathon, running a superb PB time of 75:49, taking over 3 minutes off his previous best. Alex also played a significant role in the final Birmingham League XC race at Burton Dassett, finishing 37th overall with a storming run to score valuable points for the A-team and secure promotion to Divison 1.

Nick ran an exceptional PB time of 79:56 at the Wokingham half marathon, breaking the 80-minute barrier and knocking over 6 minutes off his previous best! Nick also had an excellent run at Burton Dassett XC, finishing 81st overall and helping the squad achieve promotion. He continued to show his cross country strength at Pittville Park in the Gloucestershire League XC, finishing 59th overall.

These are both outstanding performances and thoroughly deserved. Nick and Alex have been training incredibly hard as they build towards the Manchester Marathon in just over 4 weeksâ€™ time. Their dedicated training has resulted in these PBs and we are sure there will be more to come in the marathon and the year ahead. Well done guys.
