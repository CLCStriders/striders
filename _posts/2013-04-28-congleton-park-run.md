Jo achieved a a 5k PB of 19.58 and finished 2nd lady, and 14th overall, in a field of over 130. Jo said &#8220;It was a beautiful morning, great conditions and a nice setting with the route being 3 laps of a lake, mainly on trail paths and other than going off a bit fast, it all went to plan and I got the sub-20 that I was after.&#8221;

Well done Jo!
