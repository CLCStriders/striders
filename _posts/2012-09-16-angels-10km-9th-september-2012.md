It was hot and the course was hilly but they had a good run. Amanda finished 3rd lady, 23rd finisher, and 1st lady vet 40 at 43.58. Dave Mayo was 40th finisher and 7th in his new age category of MV50. 

The venue was lovely, at Woodpeckers Cricket club in Ashleworth. They were the only 2 Striders competing this time, but there were quite a few other races on with Apperley quarter, Lido Tri and Woodchester all taking place on the same day.
