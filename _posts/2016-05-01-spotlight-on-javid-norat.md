When did you join the club?

I joined the Striders at the beginning of November 2015 after seeing the club well represented at the Cheltenham half. I was a little unsure at first, however, upon completing the 2 trial sessions I was determined to join.

Why did you join the club?

I had eye surgery in October 2015 and have had many prior to this one. My consultant advised me to ensure that any exercise I undertake would be strain free – hence why I considered running rather than doing weights at the gym. This ment I had to make some changes in my training routine. I felt running would be my best option.

What do you like most about the club?

I love how we are a ‘family’ at CLC Striders. Everyone is welcoming and approachable. The support and encouragement I have received from members is astonishing. We all truly look out for one another.

Do you feel CLC striders have helped you improve and if so, how?

Most definitely! The support, praise and encouragement is something which motivates me to continue to progress to my full potential.

Favourite race/distance?

I have to say my favourite race has been the North London Half Marathon. The atmosphere was phenomenal and it has a grand finish at the Wembley Stadium.

Who or what is your biggest inspiration? (running or otherwise!)

My biggest inspiration is to prove to my 8 year old daughter that she is right in believing in me. She will often google races and push me to do them. She is my biggest fan and I don’t want to let her down.

Did you ever think of giving up and what stopped you?

Its normal to want to give up when something is difficult, however, If I give up and take the easy option what message does that give to my number 1 fan?

Proudest running moment so far?

This has to be my latest half marathon time of 1hr31mins38s which I achieved after only having trained with CLC Striders for 4 months.

Any lucky charms/ pre race routine you swear by?

I’m sorry to say there are no lucky charms for me. I do swear by eating right, drinking lots of fluids, rest and stretches. Above all, ENJOY IT!

Your running mantra/top tip?

Don’t give up!
