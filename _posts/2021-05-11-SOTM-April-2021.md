After a long period with no races, it has been great to see Striders out racing again in April, with some superb performances & club records! (David James, John Willson)

However there can only be one winner and congratulations to Liza Bradshaw who is our Strider of the Month for April.

Liza set an amazing total of 4 PBs in April as well as a Club Record! These were:
* 5k PB - 18:29 @ Hereford Couriers Series
* 5 mile PB - 31:30 @ Severn Bridge Night race (2nd lady & not a flat course!)
* 10k PB - 38:56 @ Tatton 10k
* Half Marathon PB - 1:21:58 @ Cheshire Elite Half (Club Record üèÜ!)

Liza also competed in an elite field at the Podium 5k in April, in the same race as Beth Potter who ran an unofficial/unratified road 5k world record!

These results are very well deserved, through incredibly dedicated & consistent training, often clocking over 70 miles a week and regularly attending club interval sessions. Well done Liza.
