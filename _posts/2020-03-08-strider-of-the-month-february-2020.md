Congratulations to Nick Ledwold who is Strider of the Month for February 2020

A regular at Monday & Wednesday night sessions, Nick has trained hard recently and is improving fast

His excellent results in February are proof of this, finishing in 78th position at a very muddy Glos XC League race in Pittville Park and absolutely smashing his PB at the Bourton 10k in a time of 40.50 for 89th overall

Just imagine what he could do if he wasnâ€™t filming the races too with his finger cam. Well done Nick
