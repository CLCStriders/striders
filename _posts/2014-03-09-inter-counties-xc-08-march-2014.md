CLC Striders had 5 competitors, pictured, selected to represent Gloucestershire in the inter-counties Cross Country Championships held in Birmingham. This is also a trial to pick Great Britain's cross country team for the world cross championships, and is a top class competition with the very best runners in the country taking part. 

The four ladies taking part were Jo Wilkie who finished 210th, Veteran Amanda Steer who had the race of her life finished 232nd. Striders team captain Rachel Vines finished 246th with Vicky Veness just behind in 247th place. This was a great effort especially as Steer and Veness were making their county debuts.  
Meanwhile, Striders mens team captain, Chris Driskell, made his inter-counties debut finishing in an excellent 253rd place. Driskell used his experience and paced his race well against the best runners in the country.  
This was a very proud day for your club as we approach our 6th anniversary.
