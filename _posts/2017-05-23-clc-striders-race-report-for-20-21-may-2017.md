**Cheltenham Parkrun, Highgate Harriers Night of the 10k PBs, Northleach 10k, Worcester Marathon, Chester Half (and the earlier Berkeley 10k)**

Once again, a busy weekend of racing for CLC athletes, demonstrating the club’s ethos around achievement, diversity and inclusivity. From trail runs to high-class track races, CLC runners continue to embrace the breadth of running on offer.

The weekend began with Strider **Alex Monro** bagging a massive sub-19 minute PB in the Cheltenham Parkrun in 18:49. Later that day on the Parliament Hill track in London, ladies club captain **Rachel Vines** ran in the Highgate Harriers “Night of the 10k PBs” race, streamed live on Facebook! In an incredibly high-class field, Vines finished 30th with a solid time of 40:26:93.

On Sunday morning, a strong group of Striders competed in the Northleach trail 10k. **Martin Bick, Charles Goodwin, Jon Howes, Andrew Gage, Kyle Sollars and Chris Thomas** all did the club proud at this beautiful race around the old wool town.

Also on Sunday, **Emma Abbey** once again did battle with the full marathon distance in Worcester, narrowly missing out on her four-hour target time with 4:08 – a very respectable time on a hot and hilly course. And, up in the north-west, **Amelia Mullins** paced her brother around the Chester Half Marathon to his desired sub-two hour target in a time of 1:55.

Meanwhile, earlier the week, CLC Striders **Charles Goodwin and John Willson** competed in the Berkeley 10k on Monday 15 May, with Goodwin smashing the club’s male V50 record, clocking a time of 37:49.91 and Willson notching up his third fastest 10k time with 40:55.98.
