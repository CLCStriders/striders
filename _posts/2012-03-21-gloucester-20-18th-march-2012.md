James Waller celebrated his newly won first-claim status with Striders by leading the club home in impressive style in the Gloucester 20. James'time of 02:11:26, which won him 19th place in the race, showed what excellent form he is in ahead of London.

A number of others used it to test their endurance ahead of marathons too, and Rachael Elkins, Adam Cary, Sophie Jones, Jo Wilkie, Rob Lynch and Pat Woods all ran well.

Rachael Elkins'run is worthy of particular mention as it knocked a further 5 minutes off the club record set only a week before!

19) James Waller - 02:11:26
