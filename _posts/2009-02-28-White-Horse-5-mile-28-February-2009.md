**The White Horse Winter 5-mile 28 February 2009**

**<a name="Report"></a><a name="Report"></a>Report**

Rich Dare led the CLC Striders home with a superb 28.55 finishing 17th overall in this high class field. Phil Jowett and Chris Slade had a great tussle to see who would follow Rich home, on this occasion Phil won the battle, however both ran well inside Billy Bradshaw&#8217;s V40 club record. 

Liza Barry had a very good run to lead the women home running a very respectable 33.56, she was followed by the ever improving Rachel Vines in 35.42, and ladies club captain Lisa Boyd who ran 36.04.

Other notable performances were had by Justine Hale who smashed the club&#8217;s V35 ladies record, Tracey Densham who managed to avoid going AWOL &#8211; well done Tracey, Barney Banford, Paul Davis, Simon Dee and Angela Puffett. Unfortunately Gibsey had to pull out due to a severe stitch!!

Kindest Regards.
