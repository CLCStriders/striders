DJ Vines led the ladies team home in the final midland cross country league fixture of the season held at Cofton park, Birmingham Saturday 12th February. DJ put in a fine performance to finish in 51st place which is her highest midlands league position, Jo Wilkie followed in a solid 104th, Amanda Steer who is improving with every race did well to finish 109th, Nikki Smith put in a good performance for 121st, and Beckie Boulton did very well to clinch 168th spot. This is the ladies teams first season in the midlands league and I would personally like to thank you all for doing so well in such a tough league and for all your committment and support.
