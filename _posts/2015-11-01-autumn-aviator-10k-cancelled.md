The Striders are unfortunately cancelling our Autumn Aviator 10k race.<!--more-->

Due to major roadworks along the route, we are unable to guarantee runner safety in that section.

The club are working with the local police, council and bus company to organise an alternative race early in 2016. We will provide more details once we can share them.
