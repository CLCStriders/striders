The winning team was completed by Amelia Mullins who ran strongly to finish as 2nd Lady Vet 35 and in 52nd place overall in a time of 2:17:19.

Leading the club home and the only male Strider representing the club was Iain Porter who ran strongly over his surface of choice to finish in an excellent 8th place with a time of 1:45:03.
