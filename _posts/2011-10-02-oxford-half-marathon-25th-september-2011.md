Matt's chip time was 1:59:11 which is a new PB by 15 and a half mins! 

This really nice race comes highly recommended as it's only an hour down the road and although there are a few gentle hills (and a really nice long downhill) it definitely has PB potential written all over it. 

There's also a really nice finish as you end in the Kassam Stadium cheered on by what feels like a packed stand!
