The 3 mile beginners group will be suspended to allow our group leaders to focus on the 4 mile social and the 6 mile groups. If you currently run in the 3 mile group, you are very welcome to attend Chris's excellent Wednesday night improvers group as an alternative. Please see the <a href="https://www.clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=76" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">training pages</a>for full details.
