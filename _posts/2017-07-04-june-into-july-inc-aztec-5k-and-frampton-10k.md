CLC Striders have been busy competing since the Cotswold Way Relay, ensuring a strong finish to June and start to July.

In the Boddington 10k on Sunday 25 June, vets Paul Northup and Gordon Bendall represented the club, clocking 38:52 and 50:29 respectively.

On Tuesday 27 June, three Striders made the trip down to Bristol to compete in the final Aztec 5k race of the series. It was a good night for all three, with Sophie Longmore continuing her rich vein of form with a sub-20 PB time of 19:55, Patricia Sturgess just outside her PB in 20:28 and Andrew Gage – who has run most of the Aztec series this year – rewarded with a PB time of 21:51.

On Wednesday 28 June, club nomad Rich Shardlow ran in two events at the Perivale Open meet, clocking a new club age category record for the mile in 5:32 and later on the same evening managing a very strong 18:36 in the 5,000m.

And finally, on Monday 3 July a good contingent of Striders travelled to Frampton on Severn for the 10k evening road race there. Will Pearce was first home for the club in 38:12 after pacing Chris Hale, coming out of retirement to race, to a time of 38:32. Sophie Longmore ran well again and was first club lady home in 40:49, with Karlien Heyrman second lady home for the club in 43:38. These four runners were followed home by the rest of the crew – super-vet Ed Collier in 44:35 and the metronomic Gavin Jerman in 44:41, Gary Smith in 46:34, Andrew Gage 47:01, Mike Crossley 48:21, Dan Harte in 48:53, Emma Abbey 48:58, Kyle Sollars in 49:42, Gordon Bendall 50:41, Charle Haward 52:17, Carla Quirighetti in 54:09 and Daniel Farrelly in 58:12.

Attention now turns to the track in earnest and the Cheltenham Harriers midsummer open meetings at the Prince of Wales stadium throughout July.
