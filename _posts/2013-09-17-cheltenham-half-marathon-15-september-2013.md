CLC Striders athletes had a weekend to remember with some fantastic performances in a half marathon extravaganza. The cooler temperatures of Autumn are an ideal time to attempt this challenging distance, and the Striders had representation at home in Cheltenham&#8217;s Half Marathon as well as further afield in Chippenham, Bristol, Newcastle (for the Great North Run) and even Stockholm.

Starting in Cheltenham, it was a delight to see a big race worthy of the town, and one can only hope it will continue in future years. Conditions were cool and damp but decent for long distance running, and the weather did not deter a supportive crowd. The performance of the day came from Alice Johnston, smashing through the 1h 30 barrier for the first time and finishing 3rd lady in 1.27.27. Rich Shardlow led the men home in an excellent 1.23.36, which was 26th overall and 6th placed in the V40 category. There were numerous other excellent performances including Jo Maddocks also ducking under 1h 30 in 1.29.31.  
Away from home, Hilary Mott ran a huge PB of 1.26.09 in winning the Chippenham Half Marathon, a sensational effort for someone usually accustomed to shorter distances. Bristol was also the place to be for PBs with Helen Howes running 1h 46 and Martin Brown taking 3 mins off his previous best. In the Great North Run, Dan Harte struggled manfully against wind and rain to finish in 1h57, while Sue Clark conquered the elements and smashed her PB with a 1h57. Finally, Dave Smeath flew the flag for the Striders in Sweden, completing the Stockholm Half in 1h28.
