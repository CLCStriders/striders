On a very cold January morning, with the hills around Cheltenham covered with snow and sleet driving in to low levels on a bitter wind, a good crop of Striders lined up to join the fray – along with 230 other runners – for the annual Almost Athletes’ Linda Franks Five-mile race, run around two laps of a course on the edge of Hatherley and the Reddings in west Cheltenham.

The first three club runners home have all been training together for the London marathon and those miles paid dividends. **Jon Howes** turned in a stellar performance, finishing in 16<sup>th</sup> place as the 3<sup>rd</sup> MV40 in 29:36. He was followed home by **Mark Fuller** in 19<sup>th</sup> place in 29:50, and **Paul Northup** in 29<sup>th</sup> in 29:53 as the 3<sup>rd</sup> MV50 finisher (breaking his own club record for the distance). All three bagged PBs, finishing in under 30 minutes.

Next home, in identical times of 31:16 and 35<sup>th</sup> and 36<sup>th</sup> positions, were **Andy Brookes** and **Chris Hale**. Chris paced his fellow club member Andy to what was a much-faster-than-expected PB for him – and 6<sup>th</sup> MV50 finisher to boot.

Finishing in 41<sup>st </sup>place, **Clark Lawson** set a new PB time of 31:46, while **Karlien Heyrman** also ran a PB time of 32:01 to finish as only the 3<sup>rd</sup> senior lady in 45<sup>th</sup> position overall. Close behind was **Javid Norat**, 46<sup>th</sup>, in a time of 32:19.

**Helen Knight**, finished 3<sup>rd</sup> in her LV35 category, clocking a time of 32:45 in 54<sup>th</sup> place overall, with **Patricia Sturgess** as 5<sup>th </sup>in the LV35 category with a time of 33:21 in 63<sup>rd</sup> overall. Still getting back to from after injury, **Joel Freeland** tested himself with a respectable 68<sup>th </sup>place and a time of 33:56.

** **Next came a trio of runners, all of whom finished in great positions in their respective categories. **Amelia Mullins** was 2<sup>nd</sup> LV45 with a time of 34:53 (76<sup>th</sup> overall), **Andrew Gage** was 3<sup>rd</sup> MV55 in 35:21 (83<sup>rd</sup> overall), and **Edward Collier** was 3<sup>rd</sup> MV60 in 35:40 (89<sup>th</sup> overall).

**Nicola Weager** ran 37:02 to finish in 108<sup>th </sup>place, **Kyle Sollars** clocked 37:10 in 111<sup>th</sup>, **Martin Bick** was 13th MV50 in 37:36 (115<sup>th</sup> overall), **Chris Thomas** finished in 39:00 in 132<sup>nd</sup> place and **Rebecca Reynolds** was 4<sup>th</sup> LV45 in 40:30 (142<sup>nd</sup> place overall).

This coming weekend sees CLC Striders hosting their own race, The Staverton 10, run out of Gloucestershire Airport and around the streets of Churchdown.
