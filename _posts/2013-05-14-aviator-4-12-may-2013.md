Despite the predicted rain, 83 runners turned up to run the race and luckily the rain held out until theyâ€™d all finished. In fact, conditions were perfect for racing.

The race began with the trio of Anthony Bailey of Cheltenham Harriers, Mike Smith of Bourton Roadrunners and Andrew Jones of CLC Striders setting the early pace. It was nip and tuck for the first three miles before Anthony Bailey stretched his legs to lead the field home in 21:40, followed by Mike Smith and Andrew Jones in 22:07 and 22:18 respectively.

Both John Bird and Jon Howes did the CLC Striders proud by finishing in 24.17 (10th) and 25.07 (15th) respectively. In the womenâ€™s race the honours went to Michelle Carroll of Almost Athletes in 25.44 for the second year running. Carroll was followed by CLC Stridersâ€™ very own Amanda Steer in 27.07 and Katie Butler in 27.30 in her club debut.

Many thanks to all of our participants, organisers, marshalls and supporters who made it possible.
