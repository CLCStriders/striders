The annual pilot 4 mile race was the usual out and back course and with wet and windy conditions it saw a modest turnout of around 50 keen runners looking to burn of the Christmas and boxing days excesses.

Rich Dare led from the start with Harry Bishop of Severn taking close order, the two started well and quickly established a lead over the rest of the field, reaching the first mile marker in 5.25 before the pace then slowed a little as the headwind increased and the two hit the not insignificant hill at about the 1.5 mile mark, the brisk headwind meant the first half was always likely to be a little slower and as the two front runners hit half way in 11.08 it was followed by a much quicker 3rd mile enabling Harry and Dare to extend their lead over the main pack behind, a few surges from both leaders were carefully matched by the other, before Dare put in an extra effort at just past the 3 mile mark to slowly pull away from Harry over the last Kilometre and finish in 21.30 to take his first ever victory on the road in what was the last race of the local 2012 racing calendar.
