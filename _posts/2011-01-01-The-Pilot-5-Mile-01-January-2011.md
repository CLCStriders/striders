**Report**

Six CLC Striders took part in Severn AC&#8217;s New Years day 5 mile road race held at the Pilot inn near Gloucester on Saturday January 1st 2011.

Will Ferguson led the Club home in 1st place setting a new Club record with a very swift 25.30, only Josh Lilly from Tipton Harrier has ever run faster on this course where the record stands at 25.18.

Ferguson and Jeremy Bradley (Cheltenham Harriers) were running side by side at the half way point which was reached in 13.08, Ferguson after the turn decided to push on hard for home and very quickly opened up a gap from Bradley eventually winning by 32 seconds. Ferguson&#8217;s second half of the race was run in a staggering 12.22 and his last mile was 4.48 which is a great confident&#8217;s boost for him. Jon Gould followed Ferguson in 8th place recording a fine pb time of 29.48, Rachel Vines was next in 22nd place (2nd lady) running a solid 32.38, John Howes followed in 30th with a pb of 33 min&#8217;s flat, Nicholas Von Benzon was next Strider in 32nd place setting a new M55 record with a time of 34.46, Helen Howes was the final Strider to finish smashing her pb by four minutes to record 40.37 and finish 49th overall.
