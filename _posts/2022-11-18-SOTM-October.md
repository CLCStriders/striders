Congratulations to our two Striders of the Month for October 2022  Kate Telford and Fiona BradyMiller for brilliant performances at the TCS London Marathon on October 2nd.

Kate ran a superb PB of 3:05:11 knocking nearly 7 minutes off her previous best and running a huge negative split, running the 2nd half over 4 minutes faster than the first!

Fiona, in her debut marathon, ran a brilliant time of 3:43:41 setting a new LV45 club record. Fiona ran an almost perfect evenly paced race, going through half in 1:51:05. She also raised an incredible Â£3.7K for Young Lives v Cancer charity, amazing!

These results were achieved by Kate & Fiona through dedicated and focused training and a lot of hard work. Very well done to you both.
