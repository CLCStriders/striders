Congratulations  to Rob Barnett who is our Strider of the Month for December 2021.

A newer member of the club and rapidly improving week by week, Rob has already had some fantastic performances in the club vest and has become key member of the men's cross country squad. Rob scored for the A team in his first Birmingham League race for the club and followed this up in December with a brilliant run on the hilly Stratford course to finish 87th overall and 4th scorer for the A Team. 

Rob has been a regular at training on Monday & Wednesday sessions which has resulted in him running some quick Parkrun times, with a brilliant 18:40 & PB on Christmas Day. He also ran an excellent 18:50 on the Honeybourne at the club 5k time trial.

Looking forward to seeing him smash it tomorrow in Burton Dassett and I'm sure many more races to come on the road & track too. Well done Rob, well deserved and keep it up.
