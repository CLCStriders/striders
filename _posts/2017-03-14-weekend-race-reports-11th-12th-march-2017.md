Striders runners were in action in a number of races over the course of the weekend.

In the Fission 20-mile race, Andrew Paterson finished in 69<sup>th</sup> place in a time of 2:34:36, Gavin Jerman was 96<sup>th</sup> in 2:40:50, fast-improving Kyle Sollars finished 213<sup>th</sup> in 3:08:09, Mike Speke was 316<sup>th</sup> in 3:46:54 and Janet Mustoe was 320<sup>th</sup> in 3:50:06.

In the Bath Half Marathon, both Amy Underdown and Kate Wakeling posted sub two-hour times in 1:58:36 and 1:58:41 respectively. In the Silverstone Half, Gary Smith bagged a gun time of 1:49:41 and Charlie Hayward continued her London Marathon training with a sub-two hour (gun) time of 1:56:24.

Meanwhile, on the south coast, Strider Will Pearce ran the grueling Grizzly 20-mile trail race, finishing 161<sup>st</sup> out of a field of 1,600 in a time of 3:09:00. Not bad for a mainly coastal trail with incredible ascents and descents and including an inland section with an almost waste-deep swamp!

All in a weekend’s racing for Cheltenham’s inclusive and competitive club!
