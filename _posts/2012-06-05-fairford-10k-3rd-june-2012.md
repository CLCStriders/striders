6 Striders turned out on Jubilee Sunday 3rd June to take part in the Fairford 10k.

The forecast was persistent rain; however, it wasnâ€™t too bad pre race, but got heavier as the event went on. The course was advertised as Undulating but actually felt more like the Bugatti 10k-Hilly!

Despite this the Striders dug in and, with the race being part of the Glos Road Series, points were being chased.  
1st Strider home in 39th position (6th lady) and 3rd LV40, was Amanda Steer in 42.08 this just earnt her a PB, next Strider was Damian Cuke in 42nd position in 42.46, then Paul Bryant in 55th position in 44.04, then 81st position Dave Mayo had another great run in 45.50. Another strong run for 162nd place was Sue Clark in a time of 52.39 which earnt her 3rd LV55, and 200th was Sarah Sandys in a time of 58.29.
