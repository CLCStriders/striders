excerpt: "<p>Nathan ran a massive PB at the Telford 10K this morning. His new PB is 34:10, finishing 20th in the elite race. Nathan went out very hard right from the start which paid off, as he got to the first mile in 5:11, managing to mantain a great pace to get halfway in 16:50. Nathan kept strong and pulled out all the stops in the last 200 metres to make sure he got a new PB. Nathan, I'm very happy for you, I can tell you!!!, Brendan Ward</p>"
