This four-lap course took place in pleasant countryside and on flat roads and, in a high quality field, both Striders began well. With the winning time an impressive 1:10, Naomi clocked an excellent 1:34:06 (41st) - 5th lady - on her first half-marathon since Reading in March. Helen later admitted to falling asleep a little on her last lap and crossed the line in 1:56:06 (146th). However, training together on Aggs Hill seemed to have paid off and both have a great basis for some more big runs in the new year. This was a very well-organised and accessible race less than an hour's drive away between Broadway and Stratford, with excellent parking and changing. Not too expensive either, it comes highly recommended for future years - but don't expect a Brendan-quality goodie-bag!
