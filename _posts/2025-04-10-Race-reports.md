On the most perfect of late March spring mornings, CLC Striders athletes were out and about competing over a range of distances and terrains.

### Cleevewold

Eight Striders joined the field of intrepid all-terrain runners at the start of the annual Cleevewold event hosted by Cheltenham Harriers – a challenging 13 miles-ish course, with plenty of ascent and descent around and about the beautiful Cleeve Common area.

Only two weeks after making is road marathon debut in Barcelona, Rich Elsworthy proved one again that when it comes to trail running, he is supreme, winning the race by a full 5 minutes in a new course record time of 1:30:20. Second overall was club new signing Pete Duffy in a great time of 1:35:22 on his CLC Striders debut. And with Tom Fletcher finishing in 10th place in a time of 1:46:58, CLC Striders also won the team competition.

Helen Knight was the first lady home in 12th place overall and a time of 1:47:52 and she was followed, in her first race back after a long injury lay-off, by Liza Bradshaw in 16th overall and 2nd in her LV35 category in a time of 1:51:01. Jon Howes ran a solid 1:52:05, Gavin Woods clocked 2:00:14 and Gavin Jerman finished in 2:12:14. All in all, a great morning’s work from CLC Striders in the bright sunshine.

### Gloucester Half Marathon

Meanwhile, over on the roads of Gloucester, club newcomer Isabel Brinsden was the 2nd lady senior finisher in a superb time of 1:26:56, with Ellie Puddifoot also breaking the 90-minute barrier in a great PB time of 1:29:12 as the 4th senior lady. Another club debutante, Scarlett Bell, registered a fast 1:36:04 as 4th in her V35 category and Colin Upton finished in 1:48:17.

### Calne 5k

Over the much shorter 5k distance over in Calne, Eoin McQuone clocked his first official road 5k time for 2025 of 20:32, finishing first in his V50 age category.
