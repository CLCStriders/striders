On a gloriously sunny late September day, nine CLC Striders ladies travelled to Sutton Park in Birmingham for the Midland area autumn Road Relays. 

The race consisted of four 4.33km (2.7 mile) laps on undulating tarmac paths through the park, providing a rare chance for the club's runners to test their mettle against some of the top athletes from across the country.&nbsp;

The ladies &#8216;A' team comprised **Liza Barry**, **Sarah Richards**, **Helen Knight** and **Rachel Vines**. They all ran really well to finish in an excellent 28th position overall (out of more than 100 teams on the day!).

Running for the ladies &#8216;B' team were **Fiona Brady-Miller**, **Sarah Wilson**, **Nicola Weager** and **Amelia Mullins**, who finished in a very creditable 59th place. **Zoe Gough** also ran the first leg, finishing 91st out of 121 runners on that leg.
