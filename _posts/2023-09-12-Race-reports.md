Besides the Cheltenham Half at the start of September, it’s been a busy and wide-ranging start to the month for CLC Striders athletes, evidencing the breadth of running the club inspires and supports.

### Saturday 2 September

#### Meteor Mile, Staverton Airport 
On the eve of the Cheltenham Half a few Striders popped over to take part in the novel Meteor Mile race; a race run – quite literally – along the length of the main runway at Staverton Airport. On the night, Rachel Vines was first home in a time of 5.54. Amelia Mullins ran a new club mile record for her LV50 category of 6.55, Colin Upton clocked a PB time of 6.32, and Liza Bradshaw (running with her young son, Joe) registered 7.18 (with Joe in 7.16).

### Tuesday 5 September

#### Gloucester Track Open
Rachel Vines had one last crack at the mile at the Gloucester Track Open, finishing in a time of 5:50.4 on the night.

###Saturday 9 September

#### Beacons to Blacks 50m Ultra
On what turned out to be the hottest day of the year, Oliver Watkins gritted his teeth and battled up and down dale to finish an incredible 2nd in this gruelling ultra event across the Brecon Beacons to the Black Mountains. Having had to withdraw from his Snowdon trail marathon earlier in the year (on what was another really hot day), this was a massive achievement for Ollie.

### Sunday 10 September

#### Great North Run
Joining Sir Mo Farah for his last professional race was Strider Nick Ledwold (who respectfully gave Sir Mo plenty of breathing space for the adulation and press attention he deserved) finishing in a time of 1:38.37 at this iconic event.

#### Richmond Marathon and Half Marathon
On a baking hot Sunday, Ryan O’Donnell jogged round the marathon distance in 4:25:08 with a friend of his, treating it as a long slow run as he prepares in earnest to run the Abingdon Marathon later this autumn. Meanwhile, Dan Koschalka clocked 2:38:59 for the Half, having stopped to provide first aid to a fellow runner who had collapsed. The event was actually stopped by local police in the end, due to the adverse weather conditions.

#### Evesham Velo Park 5K
Helen Knight and Rachel Vines ran in the second of this new, local 5k road race series hosted by Cheltenham Harriers. Helen was first lady home, winning £50. At the time of writing, results have not yet been posted.

#### Chedworth Roman Trail
In a bizarre and painful turn of events, Eoin Mcquone had to retire from this local trail race having been stung twice by hornets after only a few miles. Ouch.

#### Lake District Mountain Trial - Classic Course 
Last but not least, orienteering and fell running specialist Rob Finch pulled out of this testing event after struggling on the early climbs. He still had a long run to get back and he wasn’t the only one not to complete in an event that saw only four finish of 50 that started.
