The Striders had four of their top runners missing so the pressure was on to keep the points as low as possible. The men responded by fighting hard with Iain Porter leading the A team home in an excellent 27th place. James Oram followed in 53rd, with Chris Driskell, progressing on the comeback trail, in a very strong 98th. Jon Howes was hot on Driskell's heels in 100th place with Neil Broadbent running well to finish 104th. Final A team scorer was Phil Jowett in a very respectable 106th place. This meant the men finished 12th team on the day dropping from 4th place to 8th in the overall standings. The next fixture will be held in January 2015 and, with the club's top runners returning, it is a certainty they will climb back up the table.

Well done to all who competed. Numbers were such that Striders were able to field B and C teams. Full results are available <a href="https://www.birminghamccleague.co.uk/images/2014-12-06-M2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
