Our contingent, on a wonderfully flat course, was led home by Andrew Jones who finished a superb 6th. First Striders lady home was Nikki Smith who was 21st in the women&#8217;s category.

Although we left Cheltenham in a monsoon, the race was actually run in dry and bright conditions. The strong head wind in the last mile and half made the run in quite testing; gritted teeth were certainly the order of the day. On finishing, the Striders retired to the bar for a well-earned complimentary drink. Well done all!
