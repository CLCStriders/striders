#### Bugatti 10k 2025

Wednesday 6th August saw a dominating success for CLC Striders at the annual Bugatti 10K road race in Prescott.

The course, beginning just a stone's throw away from the Prescott Speed Hill Climb, takes competitors along an all-road undulating course through the villages of Alstone, Alderton, and Gretton. It is famous in Gloucestershire's running circles for its closing kilometre, which has 34 metres of elevation, creating a challenge for all runners.

The course start operates under a rolling road closure, with competitors being walked from the Owners' Club down to the railway bridge in the shadow of Dixton Hill. There was an opportunity for pre-race fuelling with blackberry bushes, and the tension built as the race official whistled three times for three minutes to go, twice for two, and once for one minute... all of a sudden, the race began, and two large downhills spread out the field dramatically. Many competitors would find their 5km road PBs broken by the net-downhill.

An unfortunately-timed tractor appearing along the B4077 created a hairy moment at the pointy end of the race. Once cleared, impromptu on-course support at the Hobnails Inn spurred runners past the halfway point. A false flat along the 2 kilometres towards Gretton was only broken up by a much-needed aid station. A sharp right turn at 7.5km marked the start of the toughest part of the course - anyone not forewarned by previous years' competitors would be in for a shock, as the hill kicked in.

Fortunately, our CLC athletes took this in their stride, pushing to the top for a fantastic set of results.

First, second, and third male Striders were Joe Willgoss (34:15), Richard Elsworthy (34:38), and Max Harrison-Tosatto (34:45). Their overall standings of 3rd, 4th, and 5th in the open category awarded them a first place in the team rankings. Pete Duffy (36:13) was not far off their pace, followed by Tom Fletcher (36:55).

The day's standout performance came from Isabel Brinsden (37:08), who dominated the women's category, a full minute clear of the rest of the field. Together with Kate Telford (41:16) and Eleanor Pudifoot (43:30), the three won the women's team rankings for the Stiders.

Achieving sub-40 minutes on this exceptionally tough course were James Endicott (38:27), Thomas Burgess (39:37), Josh Davies (39:46), and Jonathan Margetts (39:53). Thomas Barlow (40:33) saw a 2-minute improvement over his 2024 race, ahead of first-timer Oliver Wright-Jones (41:23).

Tim Brock (42:51) set a new course PB after 8 years of racing at Bugatti, in sight of club newcomer Aaron Barnes (44:30). Gary Farquharson (47:47) and Sarah Bergdahl (47:50) finished together after a competitive duel on the evening, ahead of clubmate Paul Northup (48:01). The race was rounded up by Stephanie Parker (48:22), Colin Upton (50:31), and Laura Elsworthy (55:22), all three of whom finished with smiles.

Overall, it was a superb day for the Stiders in a field of 309 finishers, up massively on the 201 from the 2024 event.

CLC Striders would like to thank Almost Athletes for hosting the race, and the Bugatti Owners' Club for the use of theirÂ facilities.
