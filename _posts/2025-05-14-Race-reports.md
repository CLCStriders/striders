#### Milton Keynes Marathon
#### Monday 5 May 2025

After training hard all year, Richard Aarons ran a really good PB time of 	3:01:58 at the Milton Keynes Marathon. Keeping with the 3-hour pacer for 23 miles, Richard succumbed to hamstring cramps in the last 5k, but still finished only just outside the magical 3-hour mark.	

#### Brewer Games - Blackridge Athletics Track, Gloucester 
#### Monday 5 May 2025

At the first local track meet of the year – the annual Brewer Memorial Games, hosted at the Blackridge Track in Gloucester – Rachel Vines doubled up by competing in both the 1500m and 3000m. Always a tough ask, Rachel registered two solid season-opening times of 5:46 and 11:48 respectively.

#### Bourton Mile Road Race
#### Friday 9 May 2025
	
On a beautifully warm, still and sunny Friday evening, a band of Striders made the trip up to Bourton in the Water to go all-out in the annual mile road race hosted by Bourton Road Runners.

First home was Joe Willgoss, in a lightning fast PB time of just 4:50. Joe was followed by James Endicott, who ran a PB and set another MV45 age category club record in 5:23. Jonathan Margetts also registered a PB time of 5:32.

Gary Farquharson and Kate Telford ran together to cross the line in 5:55 and, battling sciatic pain, Helen Knight ducked in under 6 minutes in 5:58. Tim Brock ran a PB time of 6 minutes dead, a time matched exactly by the very busy Rachel Vines. Colin Upton ran 6:21 less than two weeks after the Manchester Marathon, and Andrew Danson clocked a mile PB of 6:47.

There were Gloucestershire road race medals at stake, with Gary Farquharson and Tim Brock taking Silver and Bronze in the MV55 competition, Kate Telford claiming Gold in the FV35 category, Helen Knight winning silver in the MV45 category and Joe Willgoss bagging Bronze in his MV35 category. It looks likely that the CLC Striders Men’s team have also held onto third place overall in the county road race series.

All in all, a great evening’s work.

#### Bristol Half Marathon
#### Sunday 11 May 2025 

On a hot and sweaty Sunday morning down in Bristol, Rob Barnett ran really well in his least favourite conditions to clock 1:16:20. An injury-impaired Adam Greenwood finished in a time of 1:35:02 and Deborah Rees crossed the line in 1:49:38.		

#### Sherborne Five-mile Trail Race
#### Sunday 11 May 2025 

Closer to home, over the undulating woodland and parkland of the Sherborne National Trust Estate, Ellie Pudifoot was second lady home in a time of 34:36, Luke Hunter was a minute behind in 35:28, Morwenna Suleiman was second LV40 finisher in 39:16, Nicola Weager clocked 42:24, Hannah Weager (making her racing club debut) finished in 44:34, and Andrew Danson completed a busy weekend of racing in a time of 46:56.
