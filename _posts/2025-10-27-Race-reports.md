#### Stroud Half Marathon

Sixteen CLC Striders lined up for the 43rd Stroud Half Marathon. The weather could not have been more ideal – almost no wind, pleasant sun and cool temperatures. It was to prove another great day on the roads for the club, with many athletes claiming personal bests. Alongside the Half Marathon, 2025 saw the introduction of a 10k course as well, which saw three finishers from the club.

In the Half Marathon, first to finish, in fifth overall and 1st in his MV40 category, was Rob Green, racing even faster than he did in Cheltenham for a new PB and club age category record of 1:10:29. Pete Duffy also went faster than in Cheltenham to finish in 17th place overall in a new PB time of 1:13:42 finished. Pete was followed home by Joe Willgoss in 19th overall an another new PB time of 1:13:58, PB. Three Striders in the top 20 finishers in such a large and strong field was a great achievement for the club.

Also running strongly were Tom Fletcher, who registered a PB time of 1:18:51, James Endicott, bettering the club age category record, in 1:20:20, Jon Margetts in a PB of 1:23:11 and Gavin Woods in a PB of 1:24:43. Club coach Jamie Hartnoll also clocked a PB of 1:25:15, finishing just ahead of Fred Reid who also ran a PB of 1:26:29. Oliver Wright-Jones, who finished in a PB time of 1:28:09 ran together for most of the race with Helen Knight, whose 1:28:37 earned her 1st place in her FV40 category and 6th lady overall and improved on her VF45 club category record. Not far behind was Andy Richardson who was the 12th Strider to break the 90-minute barrier on the day with a PB time of 1:29:07.

Matt Ashman turned around his Cheltenham disappointment in clocking 1:35:00 and Sarah Bergdahl ran a new PB by over 4 minutes in a time of 1:39:34. Colin Upton beat his performance at the Gloucester Half earlier in the year to claim a new PB of 1:47:21 and the final Strider to complete the Half was Samuel Brogden in 1:55:15.

In the 10k event, Ellie Pudifoot clocked a new PB of 41:47, crossing the line in 10th overall and as the 2nd lady. Edward Collier finished 3rd in his MV65 category with a time of 52:57, while Deb Cartlidge was 5th in the FV50 category in 58:38.

Meanwhile, a little further from home, Adam Greenwood continued his meticulous marathon preparation with a solid 1:26:08 in the Maidenhead Half.

In the warmth of southern Spain, Gary Farquharson and Kate Telford completed their latest European Classic Half Marathon in Valencia, pacing each other, half and half, Kate coming home in 1:41:20 (on her birthday, just a week after running the Abingdon Marathon) and Gary crossing the line in 1:41:21.
