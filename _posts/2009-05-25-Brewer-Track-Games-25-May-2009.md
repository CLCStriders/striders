The Brewer games held at the prince of wales stadium produced some great results for the three CLC striders who took part. Will Ferguson won the 800 metres in a club record time of 2.09.5, closely followed by Phil Jowett in 4th place running a superb 2.14.3, to smash his previous v40 personal best by over 3 seconds, and he also set a new club V40 record to boot. 

The striders in the 200 metres had 15 year old Ben Hodges who ran an excellent race to record a brisk 25.3 to set a new club under 17 record.

Please keep it up as I enjoy every minute watching you perform for this very special club!!
