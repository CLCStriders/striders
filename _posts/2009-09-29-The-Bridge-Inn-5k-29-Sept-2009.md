excerpt: '<p>Nathan and Rich Dare had a great race in the Bridge Inn 5k at Bristol. Rich Dare finished a strong 12th in a quality field of runners in a time of 16mins 57secs. Nathan finished 11th in a time of 16mins and 55secs. Considering how tough the course was and especially as it was pitch black apart from the street lights above, they both really enjoyed the race.See full race report by clicking below The Bristol Bridge Inn 5k 29 Sept 2009 Photos Report Results</p>'

**Report**</p> 

As the summertime light faded and the dark descended the two CLC striders began the race side by side, under the Bridge towards the front of the pack, as soon as the gun went both worked their way through the field together, at 800m Dare took the lead only to see Nathan fight back and reassert himself in front where he sat for the next 2k unable to shake off the Dare Devil. 

Both hit the halfway point in 8mins 15sec, the duel had forced the pace and meant both had set off too swiftly, it was going to be a painful last 2.5k for both runners and so it proved, the undulating course began to assert itself and the pace of both runners dropped through to the 3.5k mark with Nathan forging a 200m lead.

At the final 1k Dare began to fight back and slowly reeled in the gap Nathan had fought to create, with just 400m remaining a sly glance from Nathan warned him that the Dare express was coming through and he upped his pace. With both runners running flat out Dare found himself just 20 metres behind only for Nathan the special one, to put in a little burst and ensure he crossed the line first. 

It had been a tough battle but he?d won this one, yet the war is far from over and we look forward to the next installment.
