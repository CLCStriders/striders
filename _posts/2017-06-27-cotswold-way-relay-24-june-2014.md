Saturday 24<sup>th</sup> saw CLC Striders enter three teams into the iconic and much-loved Cotswold Way Relay. Now in its 25<sup>th</sup> year as an event, this year, once again under the expert coordinating eye of Liza Barry, the club gathered a ladies team (the Gazelles) and two mixed teams (the Eagles and Cheetahs) – of all abilities and specialisms – to tackle the ten-leg course from the north to the south of the beautiful Cotswold Way. Starting in Chipping Campden and finishing in the centre of Bath, this is a local race like no other and all those who competed had a fantastic experience.

Standout performances of the day came from **Karlien Heyrman**, lead-off lady for the CLC Gazelles team, who was first lady home on **Leg 1**, marking a remarkable return to fitness and form after a long lay-off with injury through last winter. Meanwhile, **Nick Barry** was the first finisher on **Leg 5** – continuing his supreme record in the event, having won most of the legs he’s competed in over the years.

In detail, the legs and performances broke down as follows:

The early starters on **Leg 1** from Chipping Campden to Stanway were Karlien Heyrman for the Gazelles, Jon Howes for the Cheetahs and Nikki Smith for the Eagles. Jon finished in a very strong 12<sup>th</sup> place, Karlien was an incredible 19<sup>th</sup> overall and first lady home, and Nikki secured 78<sup>th</sup>. CLC Striders were up and running.

On **Leg 2**, from Stanway to Cleeve Common, Billy Bradshaw brought the Cheetahs team home in 33<sup>rd</sup> place, with Rachel Vines in 40<sup>th</sup> for the Gazelles. Dawn Addinal battled through for 110<sup>th</sup> place for the Eagles. Two legs down, eight to go!

**Leg 3**, from Cleeve Common to Seven Springs, saw Si Thomson finish in 34<sup>th</sup> place for the Eagles, Emma Abbey in 64<sup>th</sup> place for the Gazelles and Jo Thomson in 82<sup>nd</sup> place for the Cheetahs.

The next leg, **Leg 4**, from Seven Springs to Cranham, saw the club manning the water station at Crickley Hill as part of their commitment to the event – as well, of course, as running it. Filling in at just 12 hours notice, new club runner Ed Collier finished the leg in 41<sup>st</sup> place for the Eagles, with club stalwart Rob Bircher in 43<sup>rd</sup> for the Cheetahs and Patricia Sturgess in a strong 46<sup>th</sup> place for the Gazelles. Undoubtedly the best bunched finishes across all the legs from these three CLC athletes.

In the end the all-ladies, all-abilities, **Gazelles team finished in a superb fourth place** in a tightly contested race, less than an hour behind the winners over the 10-leg, 100-mile or so course – a very slim margin indeed. While, in the mixed team races, **CLC Cheetahs finished in 17<sup>th</sup> position and CLC Eagles finished in 31<sup>st</sup>** – once again, really strong placings in a field of some 50 or so mixed teams.
