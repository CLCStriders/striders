Three Striders made the trip to Bristol  to compete in the Aztec West fast 5km on Tuesday.

On a freezing cold evening, Rachel Vines led the club home in 85th place with a massive PB of 18'54 to dip below the 19 minute mark for the first time. Next was Amanda Steer who ran well to finish in 150th place in a time of 21'35, and she was followed by Chris Thomas who also ran well to finish in 179th place in a time of 23'31.
