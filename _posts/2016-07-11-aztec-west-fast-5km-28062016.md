CLC Striders had an excellent evening at the Aztec West Fast 5km last Tuesday.

In cool and wet conditions, the Striders had a strong turnout despite many club members having very recently competed in the Cotswold Way Relay.

Leading the club home in 94th place, fresh from her stage 9 victory in the CWR was Katie Truslove with a new PB of 19:33; next for the club in 97th place with a new PB of 19:36 was Karlien Heyrman, and Heyrman was closely followed by JJ Willson in 99th place with an excellent time of 19:40. Andrew Paterson followed in 111th place setting a massive new PB of 20:02, and completing the line-up were Andrew Gage in 171st place with a new PB of 22:39 and debutant Chris Thomas with a time of 23:49.
