On Sunday morning, 10th September 2017, four Striders made the trip north to compete in Stratford’s Big 10k event.

Once again, even though labouring with a cold, **Sophie Longmore** demonstrated her class by finishing as the first lady in a time just outside the magic 40 minutes, but in a PB of 40:14 on the day.
