On Sunday morning, 10th September 2017, four Striders made the trip north to compete in Stratford’s Big 10k event.

Once again, even though labouring with a cold, **Sophie Longmore** demonstrated her class by finishing as the first lady in a time just outside the magic 40 minutes, but in a PB of 40:14 on the day.

Next home, as 42<sup>nd</sup> man in his V45 age category was **Martin Bick** in a time of 46:24. Hot on his heels was the up-and-coming **Kyle Sollars** in 46:50. And the fourth CLC finisher on the day was **Carla Quirighetti**, as ninth lady in her V45 age category in a time of 52:21 – a new PB by a massive two minutes!
