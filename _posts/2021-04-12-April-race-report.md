Itâ€™s been a long time coming, but after a long, cold winter lockdown away from racing, a handful of Striders were well and truly unleashed this Easter.

First up, were three Striders travelling over to compete in the Hereford Couriers 5k Series. On a cold but still evening on Wednesday 7 April, all three excelled in the fast and well-organised race. Liza Bradshaw finished as seventh lady overall and third in her age category in a super-fast time of 18:29. JJ Willson ran within one second of his PB in 19:03 for third place in his MV60 age category. And, saving the best until last, David James, at 71, ran 20:57 to win his age category but also gain the top ranking in the country this year for his age category over 5k. 

Meanwhile, on Sunday 11th April, Eoin McQuone returned to happy hunting grounds for him at Castle Coombe to run a PB time of 39:53 for sixth position in his MV50 age category in the Chilly 10k.

After so long away from competition the club is thrilled at just how well all their athletes performed. We hope it points to a summer of great achievement for the club and its runners.
