Chris Hale aka GPS smashed the 30 mins barrier, beating the club V40 record, completing the race in 29:40. Chris was the first V40 home, in 4th place overall at the Whitehorse 5 mile race.

Phil Jowett aka Jowster finished in a respectable 31.36 to finish 3rd in the V40 category, and 10th overall place. 

Chris and Phil enjoyed 3 packets of the coveted White Horse winner?s biscuits. 

Many thanks to Justine for taking some great photo&#8217;s and providing great support (along with Evan).
