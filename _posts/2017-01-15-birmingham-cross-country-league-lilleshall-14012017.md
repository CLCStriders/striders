CLC Striders men performed superbly in the penultimate Birmingham XC League Division 2 fixture of the season held on a boggy  and very slippery course at Telford. The Men's A team finished 9th on the day, and have moved up to 8th place in the team series.  
The Brendan Ward coached athletes were led home by Will Ferguson  in an excellent 9th place; Iain Porter ran strongly to finish 26th; Sam Baylis followed in 36th place seeming to suit the tough conditions; next man for the club was Chris Driskell who put in his best series performance to finish an excellent 61st, Jon Howes fought hard in the conditions and finished  5th man for the A team in 116th place, and final A team scorer was Will Pearce who has just recovered from flu. Pearce finished in 118th place to seal the club's points.  
Meanwhile the Striders  B team were led home by Rob Bircher, who ran well to finish 164th place; Chris Thomas was next man home for the B Team battling well to finish 208th; just behind Thomas there was a battle between three Striders for the next position, Dave Street won the battle to finish 209th, with super vet David James finishing 210th, and final B team member Kyle Sollars in 211th spot.
