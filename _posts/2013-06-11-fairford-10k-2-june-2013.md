After the miserable weather of last years race, sunshine and warmth greeted this years competitors. Sue Clark finished in 52:26 in overall 213 and an excellent 9th in her category. &#8220;The course was quite demanding with quite a few inclines along the way! A very nice route with lots of lovely lanes to run along. This year they added chip timing which was brilliant.&#8221;

Andrew Paterson defied the warm weather and the hills and beat his PB, breaking 45 mins for the first time, finishing in 44.41 &#8211; 78th overall and 21st in his category. &#8220;At the start the pace soon settled down as a decent gradient greeted everyone after the first bend, and seemed to continue for the next 6km. The scenery was great, and every time we came across one the few houses en-route there would be people outside cheering on someone local. With the temperature climbing higher the thought of stopping for an ice-cold cider at one of the pubs was tempting, but I settled for a bottle of water at the half-way mark. The water did the trick, and for me the last 4k seemed to fly by, probably assisted by the gentle decline into the finish. On the finishing stretch it did seem as though the whole village was out cheering everyone home with words of encouragement. Water, bananas, t-shirt and goody bag, along with chip timing, and instant results all added to a value for money race. Well worth a try next year for those that want a local friendly run&#8221;.

Well done all. Full Striders results were:
