CLC Striders kicked off the 2016/17 cross country season held at Little Rissington on Saturday, and fielded a squad of 30 runners.

The ladies race was first to start, and new signing Emily Smith stormed to victory winning by 1 minute 48 seconds. Smith who last raced seriously back in November 2015, ran away from a strong field on the first hill, and very quickly built up an unassailable lead by the finish. Next home for the A team was Helen Hucker in an excellent 25th place; ladies' captain Rachel Vines followed Hucker, running strongly over the last lap to finish 26th. CLC ladies finished 4th team on the day. Amanda Steer led the B team home in a solid 40th place (3rd lv45) Amelia Mullins followed in 45th, final B team scorer was Pat Sturgess in 49th place.
