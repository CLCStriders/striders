Congratulations to John Comer who is our Strider of the Month for September 2022.

Since joining Striders and consistently attending club sessions, John has improved at a rapid rate. This focused training has resulted in excellent recent race performances.

John was 6th overall at the Bugatti 10k and followed this up in September, running a brilliant PB at the Cheltenham Half of 1:21:38 for 34th overall. 

John also played a key role in the A Team at the Midland 6 Stage Road Relays, running a strong debut time of 21:20 for the 5.88km course at Sutton Park. This helped the team qualify for the National Road Relays last weekend, where John raced again helping the Striders men's team to its best ever result in the competition.

Well done John and sure there is plenty more to come.
