Last Sundayâ€™s Wilmslow Half marathon, which incorporated the England Half Marathon Championships, saw weather conditions that were bright and sunny albeit a little too warm for running.

Of more concern for Jo, however, was the knowledge, following an inspection the previous day, that the course wasnâ€™t quite as flat as expected, with a few gradual slopes and short inclines, which would make themselves felt in the race. 

Not to be deterred Jo went off hard only to â€˜dieâ€™ slightly in the second half, but having revisited her Garmin splits it would appear the 2<sup>nd</sup>half contained the majority of the uphill and so Jo was reassured that she hadnâ€™t blown up, just slowed somewhat as an inevitable consequence of the terrain! 

Jo still smashed her PB by 3 and a half minutes recording a time of 1:32.47 and finished 17<sup>th</sup>Senior Lady and 377<sup>th</sup>overall, so on reflection was very happy with her performance. It was also the largest ever Wilmslow Half Marathon with over 4,000 runners finishing the race.
