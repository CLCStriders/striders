The Striders ladies, who already head the league by 70 points, got the day off to a cracking start. With three A team scorers in the top six of the race and three B team scorers in the top 12, both teams finished first and second on the day which is an immense performance. It was a fierce scrap to see who would lead the club home. Liza Barry proved to be the strongest finishing in 3rd place and achieving her best ever placing in the county league. Rachel Vines had a storming run to finish in 5th place with the run of her life. Following two seconds behind Vines was Katie Truslove who ran a fantastic race to come home in 6th. Karlien Heyrman ran well to lead the B team home in a superb 8th place, with Jo Wilkie following in a solid 11th place. Vicky Veness completed the B team in a fine 12th place. The Striders Masters team, comprising of Wilkie, Amanda Steer and Amelia Mullins did very well to finish third team on the day.

Meanwhile the Striders men also had a fabulous day clinching third team on the day beaten only by the Cheltenham Harriers A and B teams. Will Ferguson led the the way in a respectable 11th place. Nick Barry, struggling with an injury, earned vital points for the club finishing in 18th place while the ever improving Iain Porter followed in an excellent 24th place. James Oram ran well for 31st place with Chris Driskell backing up well in 50th place. Jon Cooke completed the line-up being the sixth A team scorer in a pleasing 54th place. 

The Striders B team were ninth on the day and were led home by Mark Langman in 59th place. Jon Howes, Phil Jowett, Rich Shardlow, Dave Billingham and Jo Maddocks completed the B team scorers.
