Joel Freeland was first to take to the track in the 400m, having not run on a track for seven months he was looking to blow away the cobwebs and post a benchmark time to chip away at through the summer. Joel started strongly but soon remembered quite how tough the event was and with 200m to go found himself at the back of the field, powering through with lactic filled legs and into a brutal headwind on the home straight he finished in 57.3 seconds, one second above his PB but a whopping 0.6 seconds quicker than in the same race last year. Room for improvement but not too disheartening given the difficult conditions 

Hollie Wharton was next to compete and made her return to track running following a short 11 year break since her last outing. She didn't disappoint on her CLC debut, running a strong 400m in 73.3 seconds, taking 7 seconds off of the senior women's club record in the process. Given her ability to speak legibly to complain about the home straight headwind straight after finishing there is clearly more to come from Hollie in the forthcoming track season

Rich Cannock completed the team trio by running in a very competitive 800m field. The sight of his competitors strutting in their Team England athletics track suits did not deter Rich who had made a last minute decision to run following a knee injury. Rich ran even paced laps to finish in 2:20 and he looks in good shape to improve on this throughout the season.

This was the first of three open meetings to be held at the Worcester track this year, it would be great to see more Striders at the remaining two fixtures
