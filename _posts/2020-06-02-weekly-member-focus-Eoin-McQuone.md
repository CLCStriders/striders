Each week we are going to share an update on a member of the club and the activities they are undertaking to keep running during lockdown.

This week we focus on **Eoin McQuone** who serves as Club Treasurer, Staverton 10 mile Race Director and is a regular attendee at club training events and a participator in cross country and races for the club.

Eoin was due to run the London Marathon for IT Schools Africa on 26th April 2020. Following its postponement he instead took part in the 2.6 Challenge by successfully running 26 miles twice in 6 days. 

On 30th April this year, Eoin shared his 50th birthday alongside Captain Tom Moore's 100th. A fantastic video of friends and family compiled by his daughter hopefully made a lockdown milestone birthday an enjoyable one. 

In honour of this milestone Eoin undertook the 5-5-5 challenge by running 50 miles in 5 days raising money for the NHS. He started the challenge on the 26th April running 10 miles each day until completion on his 50th birthday.

Well done Eoin, a really fantastic effort and fingers crossed the London Marathon will take place on Sunday 4 October 2020 as planned.
