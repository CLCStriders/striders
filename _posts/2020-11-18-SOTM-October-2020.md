Congratulations to Oliver Watkins, who is our Strider of the Month for October 2020.

Despite the Barcelona Marathon being cancelled in the spring due to Covid, and a calf injury in July, Ollie stayed committed to his pursuit of a marathon PB this year. With races returning, he picked back up his dedicated training in August with a place at the Bedford Autodrome Marathon in October.

When the day came on October 18th, Ollie ran a brilliant race to finish in an incredible time of 2:48:47 for a huge PB, by 16 minutes!! Awesome and a just reward for all his hard training and continuing to stay motivated despite the setbacks.

Well done Ollie!
