Congratulations to our 2023 Gloucestershire Road Race Series podium finishers Kate and Joe who have done the club proud by winning county honours following the conclusion of the twelve race series

Kate Telford secured glory in the ladies' competition early doors, thanks in part to her wins at the Berkeley 10k and Bourton Mile which propelled her to the top of the rankings from which she never looked to be caught.

Joe Willgoss on the other hand played the long game, sitting into contention throughout the series but only securing a podium place following a second place finish in the series finale, the Guy Fawkes 5.

Well done to all individual and team winners and huge thanks to all of the clubs that hosted races in the series. 

We were very disappointed not to be able to host the Staverton 10 which was chosen for the 2023 series due to major roadworks on the course but we are thrilled to have been included in the 2024 series with the inaugural Boddington 10 being given the vote of confidence by the Gloucestershire AAA.
