The race, in foggy conditions, was run on country roads over a gently undulating course. Three runners, including two-time winner John Parker, broke away at the start and remained together until 4.5k when Ferguson made his move. From this point the gap grew to almost a minute seeing Ferguson cross the line in a new personal best time of 32.38. John Parker held on to second place crossing the line in 33.34, and 17 year old rising star Dmitri Nazarenko finished in 3rd place running a superb 34.33.  
Other Strider prize winners were James Oram who was first V40 and 5th overall smashing his PB finishing in an excellent 35.28, Katie Trustlove who was 3rd lady overall running a new PB of 40.49 and Ollie Mosley, who is an up and coming athlete, finishing as first U-20 man outside the top three overall finishers. Mosley ran a PB of 46.22 in 63rd overall.
