Well done and congratulations to Rob Bircher and Andrew Paterson who took on the Apocalypse Ultra Marathon on 14th May. This race takes place in the  Shropshire Hills with race HQ at at Church Stretton.  On a blistering hot day Paterson and Bircher  easily managed to reach the minimum requirement of 27miles;  then, after a missed checkpoint and some dodgy self navigation, they pushed on to reach 45miles before calling it a day.  This was an incredibly tough course which included 10,000ft of ascent.
