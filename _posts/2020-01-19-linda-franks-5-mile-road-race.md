On a crisp, bright January morning, CLC Striders were well represented at the local Linda Franks 5-mile road race, hosted by Almost Athletes. The two-lap course weaved its way around the Reddings and Hatherley, with potentially treacherous icy patches on some corners. Nevertheless, the flat terrain lent itself to some fast times and several new personal bests for CLC runners. 

Leading the Striders home was club chair Jon Howes in 18th place overall and clocking a speedy 30:01. He was followed by Striders’ first lady home, and 3rd lady overall, Helen Knight, in 31:25. Next came the improving duo of Nick Ledwold in 32:28 and Matt Ashman in 33:34, both earning themselves PBs.   

Next in was the ever-consistent Amelia Mullins in 34:11, followed by Gary Smith with a PB of 34:23 and Andrew Gage, also with a PB time of 34:41. Hedley Philips continued his return to fitness after injury with 35:08 and super-vet Ed Collier ran 35:34. Nicola Weager clocked a PB of 36:24, giving the Striders ladies’ team a fantastic first prize. Helen Howes finished in 36:55 and Mike Speke, taking a break from his marathon training, registered 40:04.
