Super Vet Charles Goodwin shone as brightly as the hot summer sun to achieve an impressive podium finish in the Stroud Trail Half marathon. Goodwin, also known as &#8216;The Postman' because he always delivers, set off at a brisk pace with the leaders and was running strongly on the scenic but challenging course. However some navigational difficulties as the course went out into the country led to an unintended diversion. He showed customary determination to shrug off the mishap and finished in 3rd place in 1h51.

David Smeath was 28th in 2h09, whilst Ed Thompson ran impressively to 62nd in 2h25.
