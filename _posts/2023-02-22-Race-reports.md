The weekend of the 18 and 19 January saw another good couple of days for CLC Striders members competing in various events – at home and overseas.

### Gloucestershire Cross Country League – Race Day 3, Saturday 18 February

On Saturday 18 February, it was the third race of the Gloucestershire Cross Country League. Striders athletes didn’t have far to travel, with the race taking place in Pittville Park. 

The ladies team were led home by Helen Knight, finishing in 21st place overall in a time of 27:55 and as 2nd in her LV40 category. Helen was followed by Kate Telford, who finished in 29th overall and as 3rd in the LV35 category, and Rachel Vines, who finished 44th overall. Rachael Cary was next home in 48th, followed by Charlotte Kerr in 108th. Also running were Rebecca Reynolds in 123rd and Charlie Haward in 144th.

The ladies’ senior A Team finished in 6th place overall on the day, with the Masters team finishing in a strong 2nd. In the same race, Ed Collier, running in the MV65 category, finished in 102nd place overall.

Going into the final race of the season, there are a number of individual age category medal hopes. And the Ladies’ Masters team are currently at the top of their league and so looking good for the Masters team win.

The turnout for the Strider’s men on the day was a little thin. Nick Ledwold finished 59th overall in a time of 40:19, Paul Northup in 93rd (6th in his MV55 category), Eoin McQuone in 134th and Mike Speke in 141st. Short of their six scorers, the men didn’t register in the team standings on the day.

Full results of the race are available on the [Alhletics4U website](https://www.athletics4u.co.uk/cross-country/  "Athletics4U website").

### Barcelona Half Marathon – Sunday 19 February

Somewhat further away from home than Pittville Park, Alex Johnston took on the Barcelona Half Marathon on what turned out to be a lovely spring day in south-east Spain. Not just a great experience, Alex shaved nearly three minutes off his previous half marathon PB time to finish in an outstanding 1:15.49. This sets Alex in good stead for the Manchester Marathon, in just under eight weeks’ time.

### Seville Marathon – Sunday 19 February

Even further away from home, in south west Spain, Liza Bradshaw took on the Seville Marathon in near 20-degree heat – a shock to the system after our UK winter temperatures. Liza registered a fantastic time of 3 hours 9 minutes, despite suffering with a stitch, experiencing a collision at a water station, and contending with that Spanish heat. Using the event as a 20-mile training effort ahead of her London Marathon bid in April, Liza clearly has great things to come.
