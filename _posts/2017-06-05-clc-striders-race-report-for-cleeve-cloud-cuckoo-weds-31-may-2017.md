On a perfect end-of-spring evening, a group of CLC Striders headed up to Cleeve Hill for the annual Cleeve Cloud Cuckoo race. The views – and the hills! – were breath-taking. Starting out from Cleeve Common Golf Club, the five-mile route follows an entirely off-road, undulating course across grass and stony tracks, including hazardous descents and the legendary climb up from the &#8216;Wash-Pool'.

Club strong man and accomplished hill-runner **Iain Porter** showed his mastery of the terrain to lead the Striders home, finishing in a brilliant second place overall in a time of 31:53. With another sterling performance, **Jon Howes** finished in 13th place overall in a time 35:22, with the evergreen **Charles Goodwin** hot on his heels in 14th place, taking first MV50 spot. **JJ Willson** ran well to take 38th place in 38:28 and next across the line was **Amelia Mullins**, seeing off some strong competition to finish fourth lady overall and first LV45 in a time of 39:18.

There were also good performances from **Neil Reynolds** (50th in 39:54), **Gary Smith** (62nd in 40:55) and **Helen Knight** (65th overall and eighth lady in 41:10). **Gavin Jerman** finished 74th in 42:51, **Emma Abbey** 102nd (19th lady) in 46:20, **Rebecca Reynolds** 105th (21st lady) in 46:36, **Charlie Harward** 118th (28th lady) in 48:24 and **Hill Hooper** in 124th (30th lady) in 49:03.

The men’s team finished a superb second place and the ladies team finished in a strong fourth place. All-in-all, a great team performance in this iconic local event.
