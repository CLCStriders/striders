On a bright Saturday afternoon at the beginning of a new decade, a handful of Striders turned out to represent themselves and their club in the annual Gloucestershire Cross Country Championship. Held over the beautiful grounds of Rendcomb College, south-east of Cheltenham, the course had benefited from a relatively dry Christmas and had had chance to dry up a little after the autumn deluges. That said, the going was still sticky, and the terrain was as challenging as always.

Once again, the lady Striders performed particularly well across the country, striking gold across the board. **Liza Bradshaw** led the team home in 4th place overall and as gold medal-winner in her LV35 category. She was followed home by the indomitable **Helen Knight** in 13th place overall and in gold medal position in her LV40 category. **Karlien Heyrman** was the next finisher, in 16th position overall, with **Rachel Vines** registering 20th place and **Fiona Brady-Miller** bagging gold medal position in her LV45 category and 28th place overall. 

At a team level, the ladies finished in 2nd place in the seniors category and in 1st place in the vet category – a fantastic achievement.

Meanwhile, super-vet **David James** recorded a gold medal-wining 1st place in his MV70 category. 

The other male Striders competing in the main men’s race were the faithful **Paul Lockyer**, who finished in 42nd place, **Richard Symonds** in 47th, **JJ Willson**, 56th overall and a silver-medal-winning 2nd in his MV60 category, **Ed Collier** in 70th and **Andrew Gage** in 72nd.
