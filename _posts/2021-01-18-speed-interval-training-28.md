Please see interval session below, this week set by coach Amelia Mullins

**Pyramid Interval Session**

1 mile easy warm up followed by dynamic mobility, drills & strides. Then:

* 45 seconds hard, 1 minute rest
* 1:30 minutes hard, 1 minute rest
* 3 minutes hard, 1 minute rest
* 4:30 minutes hard, 1:30 minutes rest
* 6 minutes hard, 1:30 minutes rest
* 4:30 minutes hard, 1.30 minutes rest
* 3 minutes hard, 1 minute rest
* 1:30 minutes hard, 1 minute rest
* 45 seconds hard, 1 minute rest

Walk the rests, and run approximately 1 mile-3k pace for the 45 seconds & 1:30 minsutes; 5-10k pace for the 3 minutes & 4:30 minutes; 10k-10 mile pace for the 6 minutes. Don't go off too hard on the first rep or you'll pay for it later on.

Cool down easy 1 mile jog

By running for varying distances in a pyramid session, you overload the body in different ways, which leads to improvements in conditioning, endurance and speed.

Please adhere to the rules, only train if you feel fit & healthy and remember you CAN train together with 1 other person outside - so please reach out to other members/friends if you want some company. Don't forget to keep ticking off the activities for the club Bingo challenge too.

Enjoy.
