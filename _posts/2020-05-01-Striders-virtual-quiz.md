The inagural virtual CLC Striders quiz night took place on Friday 1 May. Coach Joel took up the mantle of Quiz Master and delivered a challenging but exceptionally enjoyable quiz. Rounds included general knowledge, music, sport and a special Striders round, to name a few.

25 members (some with families) joined in and were split into 5 teams. The results were close but team Flu Fighters were triumphant and take the kudos of the first quiz win.

| Team | Score |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Flu Fighters  | 67  |
| On a Loo Roll  | 61  | 
| The Lockdown Lopers  | 61 | 
| Zoomy McZoom Face  | 59 | 
| The Famous  | 58 | 

This will hopefully be the first of many quiz nights whilst we are unable to train together.

Well done to everyone who took part.
