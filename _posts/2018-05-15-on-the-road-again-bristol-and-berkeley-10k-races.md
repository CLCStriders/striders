As well as making a strong start to the track season, CLC Striders have been out on the roads in force, too, for early summer 10k races.

In Bristol, on Sunday 13 May, **Tom Kabala**clocked a super-quick PB time of 36:37 in this big city road race.

And on the next evening, it was the turn of a big group of Striders to prove themselves over the same distance in the local Berkeley 10k. It was to prove a great night for the club, as honours were won and PBs were earned.

First Strider home on the night in 13<sup>th</sup>place overall was the ever-reliable **Iain Porter **in 36:29.2. He was followed home, in a new PB time, by **Will Pearce**, who finished in 18<sup>th</sup>overall and ducked under the magic 37-minute barrier with a time of 36:57.8. **Javid Norat **impressed on the night with a sub-39-minute PB time of 38:52.2. And **Paul Lockyer **and **Joel Freeland **also dipped in under their 40-minute targets in 39:34.4 and 39:50.6 respectively – with Joel earning a long-sought-for PB time.

Evergreen **JJ Willson **came home in 40:47.8 to claim 1<sup>st</sup>position in his V55 category. **Karlien Heyrman **ran 42:01.7 to finish as 7<sup>th</sup>lady overall and bring the Striders ladies home on the night. After his weekend exertions on the track, **Gareth Harries **cruised round in 42:15.3. **Patricia Sturgess **was 2<sup>nd</sup>Striders lady finisher in a new PB time of 42:26.4 and 2<sup>nd</sup>in her V35 category.

**Amelia Mullins**won her V45 age category in a time of 43:19.7. **Helen Knight **came 3<sup>rd</sup>in her V35 category in a time of 43:30.9. **Eoin McQuone **and **Gavin Jerman **bagged big PBs in times of 43:35.1 and 43:44.6 respectively. And **Amanda Steer **finished 2<sup>nd</sup>in her V45 age category in a time of 44:13.8.

**Gary Smith **came home in 46:46.9, **Nicola Weager **clocked 47:41.1, **Mike Speke **ran 53:42.9, **Gordon Bendall **finished in 56:20.1, and **Charlie Haward **ran 56:26.9.

On the night, the Striders ladies also won top honours in the team competition.
