The weather was unseasonably cold and windy in places which made it pretty tough going for the striders. Jo Wilkie in a welcome return to racing put in an amazingly strong performance finishing 3rd lady in a super quick time of 41:07. JJ Willson led the men home, followed by Matt Cafferky.

The consistent Amanda Steer came in next in a time of 43:20. Helen Howes made up the womens team who were the first ladies team.

Gordan Bendall put in a fine performance and Becky Boulton completed the team of Striders, coming first LV40.

Full report and results to follow.
