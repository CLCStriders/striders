Sue Clark was 12th in the ladies'V50 category out of 23. Sue said &#8220;The weather was perfect and the race was well organised, if a little challenging with plenty of inclines to conquer. There was no goody bag on offer, but a medal and a tee-shirt to finish, with lots of cakes & bananas at the finish which was great.&#8221;

Charlotte Sugden, Helen Howes and Ash Bishop also took part. Charlotte said &#8220;The start seemed very unorganised start 5minutes later than planned, and the start banner collapsing but 10:10am we set off. The run set off through the town and then out onto the quiet roads of Tewkesbury. The course was predominantly flat with a few inclines over motorway bridges. We had fellow strider Jon Howes positioned around the course as Strider cheerleader which encouraged us all. Throughout the whole course I felt strong and pushed on at many points. Overall I completed the half in 1:35:52 and was 4th lady which I could have been happier about! Would definitely do this run again it was very enjoyable.&#8221;
