It was their fourth title in five years sealing victory at the final fixture on a very wet and windy course. The Striders ladies have performed consistently well since the season started back in October. Striders Head Coach Brendan Ward said &#8220;This is an excellent achievement by a very committed group of athletes who all enjoy their running; I am very proud of them all&#8221;.  
Jo Wilkie, who has been the ladies top performer this season, led the team home in an excellent 7th place. Vicky Lewis ran well to finish in 15th place with Amanda Steer finishing her best ever season in style in 19th place. Leading the B Team was Pat Sturgess who finished 20th and is returning to form; Vicky Veness followed in 23rd place. Amelia Mullins was next in 38th place with Rachel Burdick, making her debut finishing in 44th place. Rachel was followed home by another Striders debutante, Emma Abbey, who finished 50th with Beckie Boulton was final Striders finisher in 65th place.  
Meanwhile, the Striders men were led home by Chris Driskell who ran a smart race to finish in 35th place. Veteran Rich Shardlow ran well to finish 51st, Jon Cooke ran superbly to finish in 53rd place with James Oram, making his debut, coming home in 58th. JJ Willson was 115th place with final A team scorer Rob Bircher running well to finish 126th. Just behind Bircher was Andrew Paterson in 127th followed by David James in 141st, Gordon Bendall 159th, Clark Lawson in his first cross country race, finishing in 162nd place. The Striders men were 11th team on the day and finished 8th team in the series overall.
