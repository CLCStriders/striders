The committee are closely monitoring the very fluid situation around the Coronavirus pandemic and will take relevant action where necessary.

Based on current government advice there are no plans to cancel Monday or Wednesday training events. However, we would ask that for the foreseeable future those participating on either evening meet outside the front entrance to CLC Sports Centre rather than meeting inside.

We kindly ask that you all follow the advice of ensuring good hygiene and regularly washing hands. If you have any symptoms we politely request that you do not attend training and follow the government health advice.

Should CLC Sports Centre determine there is a need to close the facility we will review and determine next steps.

The committee will monitor, update and revise this guidance as the situation and government advice develops. We will update you if the outbreak starts to impact on our ability to continue to run Monday and Wednesday training and will ensure the club website is kept up to date with information. Please check the club website regularly and specifically before training events as it will be the primary source of updates and developments.
