Congratulations to Sophie Longmore who is our Strider of the Month for February 2022.

Super Vice Captain Sophie showed amazing commitment to Striders by stepping in at the last minute so our Ladies could field a full team for the final Midland XC League fixture in Leamington in February. 

Sophie travelled there with her 6 month old son (her youngest of three, also having two girls aged just 2 & 3!) and raced for the ladies, while her baby son supported from his pram (being watched by Amelia's husband, Roger Mullins who managed to keep Felix asleep the whole time!). Sophie finished in a time of 37:12 for 151st place.

Inspiring dedication to the club, well done Sophie.
