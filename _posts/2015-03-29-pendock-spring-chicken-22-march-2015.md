On a very pleasant morning, if a bit nippy, they took to the course around quiet country lanes plus about 1 mile off road over a very dry and rutted, and steep, field and track. club record in the I had to walk the 50 yards or so that went up the steep bit, as did a lot of others! There were 1k, 5k and 10k options for the several hundred runners who took part. David James ran a new club record of 24.22 for over 65s in the 5K while Neil Broadbent (42.12), Dave Mayo (47.54) and Steve Beardmore (54.31) tackled the 10k.
