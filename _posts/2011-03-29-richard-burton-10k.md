Having successfully convinced his brother and brother in law it would be a good idea for them to do it too, the loss of an hours sleep coupled with a â€œbit of a late oneâ€ meant all three took to the line in a slightly apprehensive manner.

With a minute to go before the gun, all three mouths felt dry, the foreheads began to sweat as the sun gained in strength and the lingering taste of dry Cider wouldnâ€™t budge. It was too late for anything else other than to tackle it head on! 

With lots of support lining the streets, a lead out car with clock and some of the best runners in Wales running it was set to be an exciting race, the gun went and the leaders were off with Dare getting a little caught up in the pack before settling comfortably into around 18<sup>th</sup>place over the first mile. A position he maintained into the hills at the 3k mark and successfully managed to move forward a few positions before reaching the summit of the hills in 14<sup>th</sup>place. 

Then on the final sharp downhill grabbed another place before the long, flat 1.5 mile stretch for home, then to massive family support ran through the last 200m only to get pipped at the post by a local Swansea Harrier to finish in 14<sup>th</sup>overall and in a final time of 35.22. A reasonable time on this tough course.

It wasnâ€™t long to wait for Nathan â€œDevil mark 2â€ Dare who on his usual training regime of, a couple of runs, a bit of cycling and heavy weekends of drinking pulled out a great performance to finish in 40.16 and 50<sup>th</sup>place. Then Ian â€œthe boxerâ€ Rutter dug deep to finish strongly in 52 minutes.

This is a great run, really well marshalled, very well supported and obviously well funded, with a £1700 prize pot the winner took home £250 and 1<sup>st</sup>Lady £200 and there were cash prizes for everyone down to 6th place. 

Dare devil and his family will definitely be back next year!!!

Results:

Winner: Simon Jones 30.30

Richard Dare 14<sup>th</sup>35.22

Nathan Dare 50<sup>th</sup>40.16 

Ian Rutter 130th 53.04
