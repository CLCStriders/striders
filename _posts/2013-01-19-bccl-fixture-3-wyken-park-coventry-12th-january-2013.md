The Striders, who are trying to consolidate their position in Division 2 after last yearâ€™s successful promotion lost at least 3 of their expected top 6 scorers on the eve of the race, but those who did run showed a great deal of determination and commitment. Menâ€™s captain Chris Driskell, who was himself ailing from a chest infection, still managed to lead the team home in a highly respectable 42<sup>nd</sup>place. Dave Smeath, enjoying the â€˜good to firmâ€™ conditions under foot after enduring numerous races through quagmires in recent times, showed a return to perform with a gritty 77<sup>th</sup>place, whilst Damien Cuke was chased all the way around by Jon Howes to both finish in the low hundreds. JJ Willson made his first scoring contribution for the club with a gutsy 140<sup>th</sup>place, and Phil Jowett removed his coaching tracksuit and dusted off his spikes to complete the scoring six in 147<sup>th</sup>place. Andrew Patterson and Duncan Kaye also ran with typical determination to complete the Brendan Ward trained octet.

The team are now in 12<sup>th</sup>position in the division, and will need a strong showing in the final fixture to keep the spectre of relegation at bay. The final race is in the familiar environs of Pittville Park on 9<sup>th</sup>February.
