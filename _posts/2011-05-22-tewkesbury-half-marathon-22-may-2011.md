Eight CLC striders travelled to Tewkesbury to compete in the half marathon. Although the windy conditions made the course a tough one, there were plenty of PB&#8217;s and prizes to celebrate.

The first Strider to cross the line was Jamie Paterson. Jamie maintained a blistering pace setting himself up for a new PB time of 1:25:04 (gun time) and 28th place overall. John Bird followed, with a fast paced finish, setting another PB time of 1:29:58 (61st place).

Liza Barry not only lead the women striders home but also finished as 3rd lady, finishing in a time of 1:30:20, 65th place overall. She was closely followed by Billy Bradshaw who put in a strong performance in his return from injury (1:30:23, 66th place).

Other notable performances came from John Howes, Carla Quiriguetti and Dave Mayo . John displayed a strong swift run in aid of charity finishing in a time of 1:32:51 (84th). An improving Carla set a new PB time of 1:50:58 with the help of her team mate Nikki Smith who completed the course in 1:50:39.

Dave Mayo completed the squad and ran well to finish in 2:19:23.

Justine Hale, who took part in the 5 mile race, ran well to complete the course in a time of 39.11.</p>
