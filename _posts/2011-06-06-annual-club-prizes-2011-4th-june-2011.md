The night which was our 3rd Awards Dinner went perfectly to plan and so far there are no reports of any award losses or breakages! However there are some reports of some Sunday morning training which of course was banned!

Thanks to The Beehive for once again being an excellent venue for the Dinner & Awards night. With special thanks to Caitlin and her team for a fantastic dinner and looking after us for the evening.

So don&#8217;t miss it next year!
