Nikki was the sole CLC Strider representative at Bourton Hilly Half Marathon on Saturday 18 June 2011. Despite it not quite being the lovely summer's evening race that Nikki had hoped for, she battled through the wind and hills (with intermitent sunny spells) to finish 3rd LV35 and 89th overall in a time of 1:43:23. Well done!
