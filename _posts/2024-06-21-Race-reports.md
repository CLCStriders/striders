### First race of the South West 5k PB Series, hosted by Bristol Track Club at Odd Down, Bath - Wednesday 12 June 2024
 
A trio of CLC Striders made a mid-week trip to Bath for the first race of the South West 5k PB Series, looking to test themselves with a hard run-out among a field of talented athletes from all over the region.
 
James Endicott was the first Strider home, successfully achieving his pre-race target of "as close to 18 minutes as I can get" by crossing the line in 18:02. New club men’s co-Captain Adam Greenwood followed shortly after with a new personal best time of 18:31, taking 12 seconds off of his previous best. ‘Marathon man’ Will Pearce kick-started a summer of shorter races with an 18:42 clocking and showed his intent to work on lowering his time by being the first person to sign up for the next event in the series.

### Cheltenham Running Festival, Cheltenham Racecourse - Sunday 16 June 2024
 
Closer to home, seven CLC Striders competed over various distances as part of the Cheltenham Festival of Running up at the Racecourse. Using the winding roads and trackways that are part the Prestbury Park site, the courses are a good test of any runner.
 
In the Half Marathon race, Rob Barnett clocked 1:20:50 for 3rd place overall and 1st place in his MV35 age category, while Will Pearce, in his second race inside a week, finished 2nd in his MV40 category in a time of 01:28:05, in 14thplace overall. Heather Ip was the third Strider to finish the 13.1 miles in a time of 2:22:13.
 
In the shorter distances, Kate Telford was 3rd lady overall in the 5k and 1st in her LV35 category in a time of 19:36. And in the 10k race, new club member Andy Richardson ran a time of 43:16 in his first race as a CLC Strider, Jack Wilde finished in 47:14, and Adam Hockaday in 50:38.
