In blustery conditions super will ran an excellent 3k to smash through the 9 minute barrier for the very first time and record a brisk 8.57.2 which is a pb and new club senior mens record. Dare devil in his own words ran over cautiously, and although he also recorded a pb time of 9.33.6, he felt he should of gone much faster. Meanwhile Joel took on the 800 metres for the first time in his life, joel hit the first lap a little too fast, however he hung on and dug in hard and recorded a very encouraging 2.20.9. Results 3k Men 2. Will ferguson 8.57.2 pb (club rec) 7. Rich dare 9.33.6 pb 800m Men Joel freeland 2.20.9 pb
