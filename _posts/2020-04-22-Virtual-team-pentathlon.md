Following the success of the Virtual 5k competition we're pleased to announce the details of next age graded club competition

**THE CLC STRIDERS VIRTUAL TEAM PENTATHLON!**

**The Format**

Teams of 5 runners will be carefully assembled with coach and captain input, to ensure a mix of abilities. When the teams are announced, you will then decide between yourselves which member of the team will race one of the following required distances:
*	1 mile
*	3km
*	5km
*	5 miles
*	10km

Your time will be converted to an age graded percentage and factored into your team total, the highest average team age grading wins!

The results will also celebrate the highest age grading for each distance.

**The Rules**

Once your distance has been decided between you and your teammates you will need to run your virtual race any time from Sunday 26th April to Saturday 2nd May.

One distance per person to count, all 5 distances must be completed between the team.

Please also take into account elevation on your route, any overall decline of over 30 feet will be penalised with a time penalty, as used in the previous 5k competition. The best way to avoid this is to run an out-and-back route or a loop starting and finishing in close proximity.

Please also respect current restrictions and do this from your home or find a route close to your home that you can easily run to and use as a warm up/cool down home.

Please submit your evidence to <races@clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk> by midnight on Saturday 2nd May.

*(Evidence can be from any source: ideally a Garmin Connect/Strava activity link but as we want this to be all inclusive, a screenshot or photo from whatever running watch or App that you use, even a description of your route with stopwatch time if no 'running' watch is fine. For anyone on Strava please title your run 'CLC Striders Virtual Team Pentathlon - insert distance here' to make it easy for us to see)*

In the event of a team member being unable to race due to injury/illness, we will try to find a super sub to step in and join your team.

Please let us know by reply whether you would like to take part by Noon on Saturday 25th April and hopefully we will have lots of Striders involved in what should be an exciting virtual event. We had 49 striders in the 5k challenge so it would be great to get to 50 and have 10 teams, if not more! This is just a bit of fun to keep us motivated and really does not matter how speedy you are.

The teams will be announced on Saturday 25th April, between 5 - 7pm. All going well, temporary email distribution groups will be set up to allow teams to communicate between themselves and plan tactics.

Stay safe & well and please remember to do this alone and keep your distance!.
