Sid Mcfarland, John Bird, Jamie Paterson and Chris Driskell completed the Almost Athletes Devil&#8217;s Chimney Chase &#8211; a race every bit as tough as the name suggests!

In this race, which winds its way to the top of Leckhampton Hill before making a rapid descent through woodland and fields, Chris Driskell had a solid run to take 8th place in 40:20; hot on his heels was the in-form Jamie Paterson who ran a blistering second half to take 14th place in 41:07; he was followed by Jon Bird who ran a strong race to take 21st place in 42:55 whilst Sid McFarland completed the Striders&#8217;line-up with 98th place in a time of 51:26.

The race was won by Gloucester AC&#8217;s Steve Millward in a time of 36:14.
