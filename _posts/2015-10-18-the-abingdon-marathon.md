Two Striders took on their first marathon by heading across to Oxfordshire to race the 26.2 miles on Sunday 18th October. <!--more-->

Gavin Jerman and Amelia Mullins have been seen regularly running together whilst completing their training plan, which included a number of training runs over 20 miles around Cheltenham and Gloucester.

Both finished their first (and apparently last!) marathon in fantastic style with Amelia crossing the line first in 3:31:34 bagging a new club VET40 record and Gavin finished in a time of 3:40:57.

Everyone at the club is super proud of their efforts and it shows that if you put in the training you'll be rewarded with a fantatic result.
