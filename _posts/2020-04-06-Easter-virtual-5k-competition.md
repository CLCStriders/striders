For Easter, we are going to run a Virtual 5k road Age Graded Competition for CLC Striders club members

We will do this as an individual Men's and Women's competition running alongside each other, with an overall team winner also (Men v Women) based on Total Team Average Age Grading %.

For the team event, the Top 12 Age Grade scores will count, and if less than 12 in the team a 25% age grade score will be given for each vacant slot.

For the individual event, winners will be the men and women with the highest age grade %.

You will need to run your 5km leg any time from Easter Sunday 12th April to Sunday 19th April. Please also take into account elevation on your 5k road route, any significant decline will be taken into account/penalised. 
Please also respect current restrictions and do this from your home or find a route close to your home that you can easily run to and use as a warm up/cool down home!

Please submit your evidence to the email address below by midnight on Sunday 19th April to <races@clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk>.

Evidence can be from any source: a screenshot or photo from whatever running watch or App that you use, even a description of your route with stopwatch time if no 'running' watch is fine. For anyone on Strava please title your run 'CLC Striders 5km Virtual Race' to make it easy for us to see.

Please let us know by reply whether you would like to take part by Saturday 11th April and hopefully we will have lots of Striders involved in what should be an exciting virtual event. This is just a bit of fun to keep us motivated and really does not matter how speedy you are!

Stay safe & well and please remember to do this alone and keep your distance!
