JP continued his impressive run of results in multi-terrain races with a decisive victory in the Mallard Pike 5.

In this testing race promoted by FODAC, JP saw off strong opposition including Severn AC's Kyran Hale and James Rose and Harriers'Roger Mullins to take victory in a time of 26:06.

This was JP's second convincing multi-terrain win in just over 3 weeks and with the Cross Country season only 3 months away, things are already looking promising for the CLC Striders'campaign.
