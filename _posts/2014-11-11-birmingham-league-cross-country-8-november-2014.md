The first Strider home was Jo Wilkie who made an impressive start to the season by finishing in 52nd place. Wilkie was closely followed by recent signing, Katie Truslove in 58th place continuing to show her form. The womenâ€™s A team was completed by Liza Barry who continues to improve in 66th place.
