**The Boddington 4m Time Trial 26 April 2009**</p> 

**Report**</p> 

A great morning at Boddington produced some very encouraging times. The course we used was out and back, and is almost totally flat, and was slightly windy but dry.

We set off at different intervals and it turned out to be fairly close with all of us finishing within 2 minutes of each other.

Super will started with Dare Devil and Dodgy Bren as he wanted company, he did have company for around 10 seconds (50 metres) then he was away!!

Good fun chaps thanks.
