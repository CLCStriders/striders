James ran a superb race beating his PB by four minutes and smashing the club M40 record in a time of 76.34. Oram continued his record-breaking streak a week later setting another PB and club record in the Gloucester 20, running 2.02.18. This is great news for Oram in his preparation for the London Marathon next month where he is aiming for another top performance.
