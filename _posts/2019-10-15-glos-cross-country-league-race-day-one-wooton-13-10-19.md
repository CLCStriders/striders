It was ladies day at the first meeting of the Gloucestershire League Cross Country season 2019-20. On a sodden, muddy October Sunday, Dursley Running Club welcomed runners from all over the country to compete over the parkland at Wooton Park, Wooton under Edge. After all the junior and youth races had competed over the ground earlier in the day, the CLC competitors faced the muddiest of starts to their cross-country season many can remember.  


In the ladies race, Helen Knight and Karlien Heyrman resumed their battle royal, finishing first and second for the club in 21st and 23rd places respectively. Helen was the 3rd finisher in the LV40 category, with Karlien 9th senior lady. Rachel Vines was close behind in 29th place as the 3rd LV35 finisher and Liza Bradshaw completed the first four scorers for the A Team, with a 35th place on the day.

Vets Amanda Steer and Amelia Mullins were next home in 52nd and 60th places and 4th and 7th in their LV45 category. Meanwhile, super-vet David James came in as the 3rd finisher in his MV65 category over the same distance.

Fiona Brady- Miller made a strong cross country debut for the club in 79th place and 9th LV40 finisher, with Zoe Gough finishing in 123rd place overall. Making a return to competition after long-term injury, Emma Abbey finished 138th, with Hannah Monro in 164th only a couple of months after becoming a first-time mum.

Thanks to strong performances across the board, the CLC ladies vets achieved first place in the team standings on the day, getting their cross-country season off to the best possible of starts.<figure class="wp-block-image">
