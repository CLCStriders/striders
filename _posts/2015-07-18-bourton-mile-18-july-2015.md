David James reports:  
&#8220;Three of us ran the Bourton One mile challenge on Saturday. It was a record field of 186 and meant that they had to do it as two races with all the under 15s starting 2 minutes behind the over 15s. Our times were as follows:  
Paul Lockyer was 26th in a time of 5:20 and 3rd over 40. Gordon Bendall was 78th in a time of 6:36 and 5th over 55. I was 86th in a time of 6:47 and 6th over 65.&#8221;
