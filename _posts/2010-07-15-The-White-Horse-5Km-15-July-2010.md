**The White Horse 5km 15 July 2010** </p> 

**Report**

15 athletes represented the club at the white horse 5k on Thursday 15th July 2010. The conditions we&#8217;re not conducive to fast times due to the wind and rain. Charles Goodwin led the men&#8217;s team home having a fine run to record 18.55, and Rachel Vines led the Women&#8217;s team home stopping the clock at 19.48. Age group wins we&#8217;re had by L40 Trudy Jones who ran an excellent race to record a big pb time of 23.19, and Dawn Addinall who won the L60 age group recording a new pb time of 24.13 to break her own club record. Brendan Ward (Club Chairman)
