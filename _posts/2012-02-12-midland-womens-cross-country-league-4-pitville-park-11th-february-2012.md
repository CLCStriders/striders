Conditions were perfect for a day of cross country, cool crisp air but sunny and warm out of the shade. In her first race for the club in four months, Liza Barry took the lead of the womens team. Barry made light work of the 4 mile icy and muddy course and finished in 37<sup>th</sup>place. Next to follow was Jo Wilkie, who ran hard and made up many positions in the second lap by finishing in 45<sup>th</sup>place. Super Trish made up the team hot on Wilkieâ€™s heels in 48<sup>th</sup>place. 

Vines got stuck in and completed the course in 54<sup>th</sup>place whilst Sophie Robinson demonstrated her improvement by following in 58<sup>th</sup>place. 

Helen Howes ran a conservative race, finishing in 102<sup>nd</sup>place with barely a hair out of place! Rebecca Boulton had her best run of the season by completing the course in 117<sup>th</sup>place.
