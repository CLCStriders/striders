On a very wet and soggy Coronation Weekend Bank Holiday Monday a good crop of CLC Striders journeyed south to Berkeley to compete over One Mile and 10k.

During a brief lull in the wet weather, Paul Lockyer, Helen Knight and Rachel Vines had a blast in the One Mile race. Lockyer was the first home in his MV45 age category in a time of 5:34. Knight was the first lady home overall in a new PB and club record time of 5:41. And Vines also dipped in under the 6-minute mark in a time of 05:59 for second place in her LV40 age category.

Later in the afternoon, as the rain had set back in, it was time for the 10k event. First home for the club was Rusty Hemsley in a PB time of 38:33. He was followed by Nick Ledwold in a solid 39:17 and Chris Driskell in 39:35. Clocking an identical time of 39:35 was Kate Telford, who was the first lady to finish overall in what was also a PB time for her. Also ducking in under the 40-minute mark was Adam Greenwood in a time of 39:44. Just outside 40 minutes was Paul Northup, who was second in his MV55 age category in a time of 40:09 and Joel Freeland in a time of 41:26.
