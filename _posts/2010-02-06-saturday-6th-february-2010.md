<p>Firstly I hope you've all had a good start to 2010 - I think we've all missed the training sessions over the past few weeks. However the snow and ice is melting fast so next Monday and Wednesday sessions are looking good to go ahead - watch out for a weather forecast update from Brendan 'McElwee'if the big freeze returns! Secondly, as you may of heard CLC Striders will be Co Promoting the Final Glos League Cross Country Race in Cheltenham! The course will be in Pitville Park - a location very familiar to us. This will be a big day for CLC Striders Running Club as this is the 1st race we have helped to promote and organise. The day will be our chance to stand out and show other clubs (and potential new members) that we are a great friendly fun club that can organise a successful event.</p><p>There are a number of people in our Club that are giving up their time working hard to make this race a success - so lets show our thanks and give our support by running on the day. You know the drill just let Brendan Know! If you've never run Xcountry before this will be a great place to start as the course is through Pitville Park - it would be great to see some Xcountry 1st timers!</p><p>Of course the highlight will be the Striders Social in the evening after the cross country - those that have helped organise, marshal or run will be ready for a drink or two by this time! However, if your unable to run on the day or help out don't worry, we still want to see you out in the evening - especially those that haven't come along to a social night yet.</p><p>Ok heres what you need to know..</p><p>Location Slak Bar (around corner from Taylors Estate Agents)16 Bath St</p><p>Time Sat 6th February8.00 - 8.30pm</p><p>This bar has a late licence so we can party as long as we wish!</p><p>See you there!

There are a number of people in our Club that are giving up their time working hard to make this race a success - so lets show our thanks and give our support by running on the day. You know the drill just let Brendan Know! If you've never run Xcountry before this will be a great place to start as the course is through Pitville Park - it would be great to see some Xcountry 1st timers!

Of course the highlight will be the Striders Social in the evening after the cross country - those that have helped organise, marshal or run will be ready for a drink or two by this time! However, if your unable to run on the day or help out don't worry, we still want to see you out in the evening - especially those that haven't come along to a social night yet.
