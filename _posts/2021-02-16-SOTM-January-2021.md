Congratulations to Nick Ledwold who is our Strider of the Month for January 2021.

Nick, despite the pandemic, managed to run every single day of 2020 and has continued this into 2021, running every day in January and now on over 400 days and still going strong!
This is impressive, not just for avoiding injury but for having the motivation & dedication to get out every day, whatever the conditions. It has been a combination of long runs, easy runs, club speed sessions and trail runs and it is clear to see Nick's improvement as a result of this. Big things to come from him when races are back on!

Well done Nick.
