CLC Striders were sad to hear of the passing of Dave McNamee last week.

Many will have known and liked Dave as the person who did so much for the sport through his tireless efforts for Cheltenham Harriers, the Gloucestershire AAA and the Midlands Counties Athletics Association.

Dave had a long and distinguished running career with Cheltenham Harriers setting a half marathon PB of 71 minutes, and a marathon PB of 2:32, and it was during this time that he became great friends with CLC Stridersâ€™ founding president, Brendan Ward.

Dave generously gave his advice to Brendan when the club was being set up 8 years go; he played a crucial part in the inaugural Aviator 4 race five years ago, and he selflessly helped with results at every CLC Striders club race since then.

Dave will be sadly missed by CLC Striders and his many other friends in the sport, and our thoughts go out to his friends and family at this difficult time.
