Armistice Day saw CLC Striders venturing further afield to compete in the first fixtures of their Midlands League Cross Country competitions. The ladies team travelled to Counden Park in Coventry for a race organised by Northbrook, Massey and Sphinx running clubs, and the men journeyed to the National Sports Centre at Lilleshaw as guests of Telford AC.
