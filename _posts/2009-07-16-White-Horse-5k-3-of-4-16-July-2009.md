**The White Horse 5k series (3 of 4) 16 July 2009**

**<a name="Report"></a><a name="Report"></a>Report**

We had 15 athletes at the 3rd white horse 5k on 16th july on a very wet Thursday evening, and although the club was missing some of it's big names those that were there didn't disappoint. 

Nathan Jones led the club home in a brisk 16.44, he was followed in by Wayne Usher who ran a pb time of 16.53, next was strong man Burge in a pb of 18.22, GPS then followed running a solid 18.33, with Liza Barry the striders leading female runner storming to a well earned pb time of 19.34. 

Special congratulations must go out to Sylvia Koster who set a new club FV60 record with a time of 25.19.  
I would also like to wish Dawn Addinall (auntie Dawn), a speedy recovery as she unfortunately had to retire during the race due to a poorly foot.

The course consisted of a small run out from the White Horse restaurant to start the main loop. After the loop, there was a short run back to the White Horse restaurant.
