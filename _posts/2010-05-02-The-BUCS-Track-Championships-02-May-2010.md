**The BUCS Championships 02 May 2010** </p> 

**Report**

Super Will led to half way which was reached in 16.40, and was over taken and had to work hard to hang on to eventual winner Mike Kallenburg from UWIC who ran 32.46.62 to Ferguson's 32.57.14. Both Athletes ran massive neggative splits for the second half of the race where they lapped almost all the field of Runners.  
Will set a new lifetime PB and also set a New Club Track 10K Record to boot.  
Well Done Super!!
