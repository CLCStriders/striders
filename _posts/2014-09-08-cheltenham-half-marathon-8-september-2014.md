The star of the show for the Striders was Juan Moreno, the Spaniard had been holding pace with fellow Strider James Oram for a large part of the race before breaking away to finish in 1:19:17 smashing his PB by over 3 minutes and finishing 13th overall in a field of 2944 runners. James Oram was close behind an also bagged himself a PB, ducking under the 80 minute mark in 1:19:52. Mark Langman was the next Strider over the line with another superb half marathon time of 1:20:01, Langman had bravely led the charge for Team Striders for well over half of the race before being passed by the duo of Moreno and Oram in the latter stages

The evergreen Charles Goodwin made an emphatic return to road racing to finish 2nd Vet 50 in a PB time of 1:25:38, breaking the CLC Striders M50 Club Record in the process. Super coach Chris &#8216;GPS&#8217;Hale was on pacemaking duties to see Rachael Cary show her strength over distance to finish 4th lady overall in a fantastic 1:27:14. Hot on Cary&#8217;s heels was Richard Shardlow in 1:27:57. Jo Wilkie continued her fine form by smashing herPB and finishing in 1:28:39

Recent addition to the strong Striders ladies team Karlien Heyrman ran well to finish in 1:34:28. Marathon training partners Vicky Veness and Charlotte Sugden went stride for stride over the 13.1 miles and both recorded PB&#8217;sin 1:35:51 and 1:35:52 respectively, showing great potential for their upcoming challenge over the full marathon distance. Other notable perfomances came from Emma Houldey 1:38:26, Steph Parker 1:41:06 and Gordon Bendall 1:48:05

CLC Striders won first place in the combined team award for the performances of Juan Moreno, James Oram, Rachael Elkins and Jo Wilkie

Well done to all!
