  Greetings from Canada to all Striders. I'm still managing to put in some training while I'm here in Canada although the weather has been unseasonably cold due to a polar vortex.Â  My first few runs in Ottawa in the mornings were in temperatures of minus 10. Last week we were in Quebec but I was forced to run along the roads as the snow was too thick in the nearby park. I ran out just after the selfie was taken and you can see the effects of the snow storm we had. It was only minus 8, but there was a wind chill as well. Makes you pine for the cross country races!
