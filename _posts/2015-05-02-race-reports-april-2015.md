Oram did it the hard way going out fast, running the first half in 1.18 (his personal best for a half is 1.16). Oram used his strength and dogged determination over the second half of the race to hang on and record a Striders club and MV40 record of 2.43.43. This is astounding considering he was nearly 20 stone 7 years ago. Over the past year Oram has established himself as one of Gloucestershire's top veteran runners and has proved that hard work pays off.  
Other Striders ran well with Neil Broadbent recording 3.03.53, George Parker 3.52.46, Emma Abbey setting a new LV40 club record of 4.08.04.

Meanwhile at the Stratford Marathon Ross Greening set a M50 club record of 3.28.24, while JJ Willson in the same race ran the half marathon distance in 1.32.42.
