The park made a beautiful setting for the race, although recent wet weather had made the park quite waterlogged which meant it was pretty heavy going for the ladies. The ladies got off to a strong start. Liza Barry, who was first home for the club ran a fairly conservative first lap but her strength and determination shone through as she gained several places in the second lap finishing in a 37th place. Trish Woods ran a well paced race and worked through the field finishing a solid 64th place. Third scorer for the team was Helen Howes, who gained a massive 38 places since her last Midland league fixture, finishing in 123rd place. Well done ladies, you did the club proud!</p>
