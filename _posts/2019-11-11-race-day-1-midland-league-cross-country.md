Hosted by Spa Striders, the first fixture of the Midland League Cross Country season (2019-2020) for the CLC Striders Ladies and Men’s teams took place in the rolling parkland at Burton Dassett Country Park on Saturday 9th November. In conditions that saw lashing rain combine with gusting winds and bitterly cold temperatures, the event demanded true grit and determination from all the runners. And the CLC athletes delivered in spades.

In the ultra competitive Division 1, the ladies came in 12<sup>th</sup> place overall on the day, with strong performances from their top four scorers. Liza Barry marked her return to this regional level of competition with a 38<sup>th</sup> place and a time of 31:11. Not far behind, Rachel Vines finished in 52<sup>nd</sup> place with a time of 31:45. Helen Knight was 60<sup>th</sup> in 32:22 and Fiona Brady-Miller was the fourth team scorer in 101<sup>st</sup> place and a time of 34:52. There were also brave runs from Nicola Weager in 128<sup>th</sup> place, Laura Daubney in 155<sup>th</sup> and Sarah Wilson in 180<sup>th</sup>.<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized">

Meanwhile, in Division 2, the CLC Striders men made a flying start, despite missing some of their seasoned competitors on the day. All six team scorers finished inside the top 100, with the top three all inside the top 30 – a really great achievement in the Midland League.&nbsp;
