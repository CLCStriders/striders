On a beautiful, early autumn Sunday morning, four Striders tested their mettle through the picturesque valley setting of the Woodchester Park trail race, hosted by Stroud AC.&nbsp;

The challenging eight-mile race followed paths weaving up and down the steep valley sides, culminating in a tough uphill finish.&nbsp;

**Helen Knight** led the club home to finish as 3rd lady overall and first in her LV40 category in a time of 61:00. She was followed by **Gavin Jerman** in a time of 63:44. Both Helen and Gavin have completed all three races in Stroud AC's &#8216;Roger Briers' series this year.

**Amelia Mullins** finished as 6th lady overall and 1st in her LV45 category in a time of 65:00 and **Nicola Weager**, continuing her return to form, in a time of 70:40.

Helen, Amelia and Nicola also won the ladies team competition on the day.
