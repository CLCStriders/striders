The past week has been a busy one for CLC Striders athletes, as they competed in a wide range of events, both near and far – further demonstrating the club’s inclusivity, diversity and endeavour.

### Cleeve Cloud Cuckoo Race - Wednesday 7 June 2023 

On a hot and muggy evening, a number of Striders took to Cleeve Common to race in the annual Cleeve Cloud Cuckoo Race organised by Cheltenham Harriers – an iconic, challenging and dramatically undulating course of approximately 5.5 miles on a variety of surfaces.

On the evening, CLC Strider Joe Willgoss was the first runner home in this tough event, winning the race in 32:42, nearly a full minute ahead of the second place athlete, and demonstrating his strength and class on the hills .

Rob Finch, a CLC Striders ‘second claim’ runner and lover of racing trails and cross country, finished in 4th place with a very strong time of 34:16.

Liza Bradshaw was 4th lady home in a time of 39:14, followed by Rachael Cary in 45:28, Rebecca Reynolds in 50:59 and Jill Harsent in 55:27.

### Hereford 5k Series: Race 3 - Wednesday 7 June 

Two Striders ran in the final event of the Hereford 5k Series. Helen Knight clocked another sub-19 time of 18:51 – making her the 3rd lady overall for the series and the 1st in her LV40 category – and Rachel Vines clocked 20:14, resulting in her earning 2nd place in her LV40 category for the series.

### Cheltenham parkrun takeover - Saturday 10 June

CLC Striders took to Pittville Park on the morning of Saturday 10 June to do a ‘parkrun takeover’ – a good way to support this fantastic and inclusive weekly event and promote the club. We received a really warm welcome – on a very warm morning – marshalling, timing, scanning and supporting 532 parkrunners around the 5k course. And we aim to do another takeover later in the year.

### Cheltenham Running Festival - Sunday 11 June

On a very hot and humid Sunday morning, members of CLC Striders took part in the Cheltenham Running Festival Half Marathon at Cheltenham Racecourse, with the seemingly invincible Helen Knight finishing in 1:32:54 in 8th place overall, as 2nd lady and 1st in her V40 category.
