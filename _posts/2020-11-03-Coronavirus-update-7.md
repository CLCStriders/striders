Following the announcement of a second lockdown by the Government, the Committee have agreed that training will need to be paused from Thursday 5 November until the lockdown is eased.

Monday and Wednesday training will continue this week as normal:
* Monday – Meet at 1830 at the entrance to the Honeybourne Line next to the CLC sports centre car park on Malvern Road. You can use the car park but please don't go into the centre.
* Wednesday – sign up for this week's interval session on Wednesday 4 November, by completing the attendance form. This link is now active and will remain open until 2000 this evening..

Regarding the Friday track sessions, these will pause until after the lockdown is eased.

We anticipate receiving some further guidance from England Athletics over the next few days and will update you further once more is known.

In the meantime, stay safe and keep training.
