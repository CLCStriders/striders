**Tewkesbury Half Marathon, Sunday 12 May&nbsp;**

On a gloriously sunny Sunday morning, three Striders made the short trip north for the annual Tewkesbury Half Marathon. The 13.1-mile course started in the town centre and wound its way through the villages of Northway, Ashchurch, Kemerton and Bredon before finishing back in the historic Tewkesbury High Street. There was plenty of local support along the way and the finish was lined with enthusiastic spectators. Amelia Mullins kept up a good pace to finish in a time of 1:37:25 (117th overall and 3rd LV40). Charlie Haward continued her recent good form to finish in 1:57:38 (401st overall). And Rebecca Reynolds finished in 2:10:30 (569th overall). There were 849 finishers.

**County Athletics Championships, Prince of Wales Stadium, Sunday 12 May**

Helen Knight continued her superlative form in wining a gold medal and setting a new PB of 5:27.4 in the 1500m at the County Championships meet.

**Berkeley 10K, Monday 13 May&nbsp;**

On a perfect, sunny, late spring evening, six Striders travelled to the south Gloucestershire town of Berkeley for the 10k race hosted by Dursley Running Club. In a field of 500, Striders acquitted themselves well.

After competing in a gruelling triathlon at the weekend, strong man Iain Porter turned out to come in first for the club in 8<sup>th </sup>place overall and a time of 35:51:9. Next home, in 10<sup>th </sup>place, was the ever-improving Tom Kabala in a new PB time of 36:10.8. Paul Lockyer just ducked under the 40-minute mark in 45th place and a time of 39:57.0, while Eoin McQuone finished inside the top 50 in a new PB time of 40:17.3, over 30 seconds faster than his previous 10k PB.

Ed Collier managed 48:12.5 despite battling hampering issues out on the course and Mike Speke, recovering from a virus, came home in 54:05.3.
