The promised rain never materialised, and perfect running conditions combined with months of hard training to result in some very impressive performances. Of particular note was the strength of CLC's women over the marathon distance: the team was lead home by Rachael Elkins running a hugely impressive 3.04.52 marathon debut. Liza Barry followed in 3.06.30, with Emma Skeen (3.16.47), Alice Johnston (3.19.22), Bethan Miles (3.30.28) and Trish Woods (3.30.47) giving a total of 6 women home within 3.30 to add to Jo and Sophie's brilliant performances at Paris and Boston respectively last weekend. The men were led home by Wayne Usher in a strong 2.57.07. Adam Cary &#8211; also a previous marathon virgin &#8211; executed his race plan with precision to finish in 3.08.57. GPS struggled with cramp, but despite this showed real guts to finish. Rob Lynch came home in 3.48.48, with Bruce Jockelson completing the Striders pack in 6.23.07, raising an impressive sum for charity in the process. To top it all CLC Striders were interviewed by Colin Jackson at the finish and featured in BBC coverage of the marathon. Colin was particularly impressed by Rachael's debut time!
