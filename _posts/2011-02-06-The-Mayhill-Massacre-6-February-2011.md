**The****Mayhill Massacre 6 February 2011**

**Report**

A field of 480 runners turned out despite the wind and wet to join in with the 5th annual Mayhill Massacre on 6th February at Huntley. Sticky mud, slippery slopes and a gale on the top all added to the fun with the race living up to its motto &#8220;Ouch, but in a good way&#8221;. Leading the ladies from the start, Laura's strong uphill gave her the edge to come in a clear first lady in a pb of 62.57, 6 minutes clear of 2nd lady. Laura was pleased that Brendan saw sense and let her off the last race in the cross countries series the day before so that she had the legs left to win a &#8216;proper'race (stir stir!) at the weekend &#8211; we all know how Lady K loves the hills! It was lovely to see 2 other Striders fighting their way round the race, both Nicholas Von Benzon (78.41 &#8211; 20th MV50) and Jill Harsent (97.59 &#8211; 4th FV40) braved the terrain and put in solid performances&#8230; can we get more next year!?
