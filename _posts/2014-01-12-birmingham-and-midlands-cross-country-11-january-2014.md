Will Ferguson (pictured) led CLC Striders men home finishing 24th. He was backed up well by Andrew Jones who had a fine run in 33rd place, Captain Chris Driskell in 56th, Rich Shardlow 96th and Jo Maddocks supporting the club well to finish 113th. The final A Team scorer was Ash Bishop who ran his first race for a long time to finish 115th. The team finished 9th on the day, leaving us in 16th place overall just inside in the relegation zone. With the final fixture looming, the men are in with a fighting chance of staying up when they return to Coventry on 8th February.

Other notable performances for the B team were Dave Smeath in 142nd, Jamie Patterson 200th, Andrew Patterson 222nd, David James 232nd with the final strider, Gordon Bendall, completing the line-up in 263rd place

Meanwhile the ladies competed in the Midlands Women's Cross Country League held at Droitwich. Jo Wilkie continued her excellent form finishing 48th with ladies captain Rachel Vines following in an excellent 59th. Veteran Amanda Steer ran well to clinch 72nd place with Vicky Veness following in 77th place, 

Vicky Lewis returned to action to finish 92nd with Amanda Pill completing the line-up in 242nd. The ladies are currently just outside the top 10 of this very competitive league.
