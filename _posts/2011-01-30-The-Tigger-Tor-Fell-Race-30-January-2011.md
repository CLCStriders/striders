**Report**

On Sunday Laura and family were in Sheffield for Laura to compete in a fell race called Tigger Tor. It was 9 miles with 1750 feet of climb. Fell runners are a law unto themselves and it is the first race where we have seen pre-race queues for cups of tea and cake and even the odd beer! The weather was perfect and conditions underfoot good. The race was tough, hardly any of it being on proper footpaths! Some of it involved finding your way between points jumping over heather. Luckily Laura was always in sight of a more experienced fell runner and was able to follow their line.  
The race for ladies position in the top 3 was exciting, in the first half Laura led for some of the time, but at one point had dropped to 3rd. Laura's strong climbing skills helped her secure her final position of 2nd, but she needs to work on her downhill technique to be more of a challenge to the experienced lady fell runners! Definitely one for next year&#8230;anyone else?
