The CLC Striders have a strong showing at a large variety of races in the local race calendar. The committee have gathered a list of key races for the club throughout the year. A subset of fixtures are chosen to be part of a club race series throughout the year, details of which can be found [here](/raceseries2025).

The club take part in the [Cotswold Way Relay](https://cotswoldwayrelay.co.uk/) which is an annual event hosted by Team Bath Athletic Club, usually on the last Saturday in June, and is a highlight of the running calendar year. Take a look at the club's historic results for the Cotswold Way Relay [here](/cwr).

The fixture list is below:
