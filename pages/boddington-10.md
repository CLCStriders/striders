#### Race day information
 
To help make your race day experience the best it can be, please read the helpful information below. 
 
If you cannot run, please do let us know before the day and we may be able to invite people from the waiting list to take up your place. We cannot guarantee we will be able to offer a refund if you cannot run, but we will do our best to transfer your place (and refund you if we can). 
 
As we are running under UK Athletic Rules and do not have full road closures along the route, wearing of personal listening devices is strictly prohibited. This is because you need to clearly hear traffic, runners overtaking and/or marshals’ instructions. Any runner seen wearing such a device will be disqualified. 
 
The UKA licence number is 2024-47258.
 
##### Important points for race day
 
* Please follow the instructions from our car park marshals upon arrival. (More information about car parking can be found below.)
* Please collect your race number and timing chip from The Gloucester Old Spot between 0800 and 0845 (Postcode: GL51 9SY). Any runner who does not collect their race number by 0845 will have their place transferred to anyone from the waiting list that is ready to race.
* When you get your race number, please write your name, emergency contact details and any important medical information on the reverse. Please make sure your number is clearly visible on the front of your vest throughout the race. We need to ensure that we can see your number at the finish line to give you an accurate time.
* You will be given a timing chip which should be looped through your shoe laces. Instructions for fitting these to your shoes will be at Race HQ. It is important that you wear this as we will be relying on chip timing only for the results. Without it, you will not get a result.
* Toilets and portaloos will be available for race participants at The Gloucester Old Spot, Clavell & Hind Taproom and Elmstone Business Park. Unfortunately, no changing facilities or kit storage is available.
* The race briefing will take place at the rear of The Gloucester Old Spot at 0845. Following this, runners will be guided to the start line.
* The race starts at 0900 at the top of Boddington Lane.
* Runners will be disqualified if they wear headphones - including bone conducting (UKA Rules).
* At the finish, don’t forget to return the timing chip.
* Join us at the Clavell & Hind Taproom for prize-giving afterwards and a complimentary drink on presentation of your race number.
 
Your race number also entitles you to 15% off at Up & Running (one of our race sponsors) for two weeks after the race. So please keep hold of it and pop in!
 
##### Race HQ
 
Race Headquarters is located **outside** The Gloucester Old Spot and the postcode for Race HQ is GL51 9SY. 
 
Members of CLC Striders will be there from 0800 for entrants to collect race numbers. 
 
##### Car Parking
 
**From 0745**, members of CLC Striders will be helping runners find suitable car parking. We will be using the car park at The Gloucester Old Spot and the small industrial estate further along the road. 
 
Please do not park anywhere other than guided by the marshals, under no circumstances should participants park on the road.
 
**Please note**: The Gloucester Old Spot car park must be vacated by 1145 to allow their regular customers to park (unless you are planning to book a table at the pub for lunch), so if you think you will need to park for longer please use the industrial estate car park.

#### Race details
 
##### At the start
 
The race briefing will be held at 0845 at the rear or The Gloucester Old Spot and then **we will all walk to the start line at the top of Boddington Lane together**. The race will start at **0900** and will be run under UK Athletics rules. 
 
##### The race itself
 
The race consists of start and finish sections of around 1 mile and four (4) anti-clockwise laps of roughly two miles each, with an out-and-back section on Lap One only. Runners are strongly advised to run on the left-hand side of the road at all times, apart from two short sections near the start and finish and the out-and-back section, where you will be directed to run on the right-hand side, following the direction of marshals.

There will be a large number of CLC Striders members out marshaling on the course. They will be there to guide you around the course. We have also placed a number of directional arrows and mile markers, too. Please note that marshals are not permitted to direct traffic, as road users have priority.
There will be one water station at Barrow at approximately 2, 4, 6 and 8 miles. We are aiming to make this a low waste event, so please carry your own water bottle if you need it. You will be able to fill your bottle at the water station.
 
##### At the Finish
 
After you cross the finish line, you will notice a group of timekeepers. Please do not distract them, as they need to concentrate and ensure everyone gets the correct result.
If you drop out of the race, please notify one of the officials at the finish line so that we know you haven’t got lost out on the course.
Once you have crossed the finish line, please make sure you return the timing chip. There will be water at the finish and space to get your breath back. But the space will be limited, so we kindly ask you to vacate the finish area and walk back to Race HQ as soon as you are able.
  
##### Results
 
As long as there is a good signal at Race HQ, live results will be available via [Lush timing](https://www.arrowliveresults.com/Boddington10Mile).
