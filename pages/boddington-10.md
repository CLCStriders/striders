If you cannot run, please do let us know before the day and we may be able to invite people from the waiting list to take up your place. We cannot guarantee we will be able to offer a refund if you cannot run, but we will do our best to transfer your place (and refund you if we can). 

Although Covid restrictions have been lifted, we would request that you do your best to observe a considerate measure of social distancing and try not to congregate on the day.  If you would feel more comfortable and safe, please wear a mask or face covering.  Please remember that you are fully responsible for being fit and healthy to take part in our event. If you have any Covid symptoms please exercise caution and do not travel and participate. 

As we are running under UK Athletic Rules and do not have full road closures along the route, wearing of personal listening devices is strictly prohibited.

* When you get your race number, please write your name, emergency contact details and any important medical information on the reverse of your number. Please make sure your number is clearly visible on the front of your vest throughout the race. We need to ensure that we see your number at the finish line to give you an accurate time.

#### Race details / at the start

The start line for the race is at the top of Boddington Lane 
 
The race will start at 0900 and will be run under UK Athletics rules. The race consists of an out and back section with four (4) anti-clockwise laps of roughly two miles each. Runners are strongly advised to run on the left-hand side of the road at all times and follow the direction of marshals. 
 
There will be a large number of CLC Striders members out marshalling on the course. They will be there to guide you around the course. We have also placed a number of directional arrows and mile markers too. Note that marshals are not permitted to direct traffic as road users have priority. 
 
There will be one water station at XXXX. We are aiming to make this a low waste event so please carry your own water bottle if you need it. There will be the facility to refill your bottle at the water station.
 
#### At the Finish

After you cross the finish line, you will notice a group of timekeepers. Please do not distract the them, as they need to concentrate and ensure everyone gets the correct result. 
 
If you drop out of the race, please notify one of the officials at the finish line so that we know you haven’t got lost out on the course. 
 
Once you have crossed the finish line, please make sure you return the timing chip. 
 
### Car Parking

From 0745, members of CLC Striders will be helping runners find suitable car parking. We will be using the car park at The Gloucester Old Spot and the small industrial estate further along the road. We request that runners do not park outside of Race HQ as we would like to ensure that these spaces are reserved for race officials, volunteers and other customers of The Gloucester Old Spot. 

We would suggest that runners allow plenty of time to walk from the car park as some of our secondary parking at the office car parks are a 10 minute walk from Race HQ. Please do not park anywhere other than guided by the marshals, under no circumstances should participants park on the road.
