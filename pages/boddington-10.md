CLC Striders Running Club look forward to welcoming you at the Boddington 10-mile road race on Sunday 25 January 2026, with a start time of 0900.

A flat and fast 10-mile race on quiet roads, with ample nearby parking and a well organised Race HQ, this is an exciting road race for Gloucestershire, established in 2024. 

As a club, CLC Striders is well used to staging successful races and the Boddington 10 is no different, having quickly become a firm fixture in runners’ calendars.

#### Quick Reference Guide
 
* The UK Athletics licence number is #30107.
* Please follow the instructions from our car park marshals upon arrival. We are using 3 car parks and parking is limited so you must use the car park you are directed to. Please try to share transport if possible.
* Toilets and portaloos will be available for race participants at The Gloucester Old Spot and Elmstone Business Park. Unfortunately, no changing facilities are available.
* A baggage drop will be available, but will not supervised so use this at your own risk and do not leave valuables.
* Race starts at 0900 at the top of Boddington Lane.
* Runners will be disqualified if they wear headphones, except for bone-conducting headphones that meet the UKA Rules.
* You must be 18 or over to enter this race.
* If you are unable to race, please let us know so we can offer your place to someone else.

#### Race HQ
 
Race Headquarters is located outside The Gloucester Old Spot - the postcode for Race HQ is GL51 9SY. 
 
Members of CLC Striders will be there from 0745 for entrants to collect race numbers. 

---
 
#### Car Parking
 
**From 0745**, members of CLC Striders will be helping runners find suitable car parking. We will be using the car park at The Gloucester Old Spot and the small industrial estate further along the road as well as Stanboro Lane (50m before The Gloucester Old Spot if travelling from Cheltenham).

The first 50 drivers approaching from Cheltenham will be directed to park in Stanboro Lane. There is a short walk of up to 500m from this parking area – please use the footpath for your own safety.

**Please note**: The Gloucester Old Spot car park must be vacated by 11.45 to allow their regular customers to park (unless you are planning to book a table at the pub for lunch), so if you are directed to park there, please move your car to the industrial estate car park after the race.

We would suggest that runners allow plenty of time to walk from the car park as some of our car parks are a 10-minute walk from Race HQ. Please do not park anywhere other than guided by the marshals. Under no circumstances should participants park on the road.

#### Race number 

* Collect your race number and timing chip from Race HQ between 0745 and 0830. Any runner who does not collect their race number by 0845 will have their place transferred to anyone from the waiting list that is ready to race.
* When you get your race number, please write your name, emergency contact details and any important medical information on the reverse of your number. Please make sure your number is clearly visible on the front of your vest throughout the race. We need to ensure that we see your number at the finish line to give you an accurate time.
* You will be given a timing chip which should be looped through your shoe laces. Instructions for fitting the timing chip to your shoes will be at Race HQ. It is important that you wear the chip, as we will be relying on chip timing only for the results. Without this, you will not get a result.
* Your race number entitles you to 15% off at Up & Running (one of our race sponsors) for two weeks after the race. So please keep hold of it and pop in.

#### Race information

To help make your race day experience the best it can be, please read the helpful information below. 

There will be a large number of CLC Striders members out marshaling on the course. They will be there to guide you around the course. We have also placed a number of directional arrows and mile markers, too. Please note that marshals are not permitted to direct traffic, as road users have priority.

There will be one water station at Barrow at approximately 2, 4, 6 and 8 miles. We are aiming to make this a low waste event, so please carry your own water bottle if you need it. You will be able to fill your bottle at the water station.

Please take all rubbish home with you or dispose of in bins at the finish.
 
* If you cannot run, please do let us know before the day and we may be able to invite people from the waiting list to take up your place. We cannot guarantee we will be able to offer a refund if you cannot run, but we will do our best to transfer your place (and refund you if we can). 

* As we are running under UK Athletic Rules and do not have full road closures along the route, wearing of personal listening devices is strictly prohibited - with the exception of bon-conducting devices that are approved by UKA. This is because you need to clearly hear traffic, runners overtaking and/or marshals’ instructions. Any runner seen wearing such a device will be disqualified. 

* **Please use Boddington Lane for your warm up runs**. The A4019 Tewkesbury Road and the road past the Elmstone Business Park are very busy, even on a Sunday morning, and not a safe location for running. A safe route will be marked from the Race HQ to the start line, please use the crossing point provided for your own safety.

##### Course Description
 
The race is a four-lap course. Starting at the top of Boddington Lane, it heads towards Boddington and then does four (4) laps of Boddington/Barrow finishing back on Boddington Lane outside the premises of Robert Hitchings.

**Please note:** There is a short 200m out- and- back section on the 1st lap only.

The entire route will be clearly signed and marshalled. Please note that road closures have **not** been applied for, so keep well to the left at all times (unless directed otherwise).

##### Race start

* The race briefing will take place at the start line at 0850
* The race will start at 0900 and will be run under UK Athletics rules. 

##### Cut off time

To ensure an enjoyable race experience for all runners and in the interest of local residents on the looped course, we will need to operate a cut off time. Please do not enter the race if you do not think a finish time of 2 hours or below for 10 miles is achievable. A 2 hour finish time would require an average pace of 12 min/mile or 7:27 min/km. Any runners entering the final loop (at 7.4 miles in) not on pace for a 2 hour finish will be asked to withdraw from the race as our marshals will no longer be available out on the course.

##### At the Finish
 
* Once you have crossed the finish line, please make sure you return the timing chip 
* After you cross the finish line, you will notice a group of timekeepers. Please do not distract them, as they need to concentrate and ensure everyone gets their correct result
* If you drop out of the race, please notify one of the officials at the finish line so that we know you haven’t got lost out on the course
* There will be water at the finish and space to get your breath back, but the space will be limited so we kindly ask you vacate the finish area and walk back to Race HQ as soon as you are able
