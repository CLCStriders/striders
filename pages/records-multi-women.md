Multi-terrain records cover any running events not recognised as a road or track event.

**Distances:** any distance providing there is evidence of accurate course measurement.

**Age groups:** U20, Senior, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75+.

The table below includes all men's road records, use the search box to filter results. A missing age group means a time has yet to be recorded for that distance.
