The CLC Striders annual road race series runs from August to May. This is a great opportuntity to give members some road races to target over the year and be in with a chance of winning prizes.

The club have selected a range of races across different distances (mostly local) and would encourage members to enter races early. Striders must enter and pay for races themselves, other than the Sutton Parks Road Relays where the club pays your entry fee.

There are prizes for the first three placed male and female striders and Vet prizes, with other prizes available for the person who shaves the most time off a PB (please email your PBs to Sophie Longmore before you run your first race!) and for anyone who completes all the races in the series (any races that fall on the same date, this will be taken into account for this!).

## Rules

Winners are those with the lowest score across the series. Scores are given for every race, even those not run, so even if you enter less than five races you can still be in the running. For those who run more than five races, your best five will count.

Your performance from either Cheltenham, or Stroud will be counted AND your performance from either Bath, or Reading will be counted if you choose to run any of these races. Although you can choose to do them all, if you run both Cheltenham or Stroud and/or both Bath and Reading, your best performance from either Cheltenham, or Stroud and/or either Bath or Reading will be taken, as one of your best five performances. This is because we know people often prefer to do one, or the other of these races, so felt this was fairer for all.

The club pays your entry fee for this, so please run as bonus points are available.
