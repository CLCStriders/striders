__Q__: I am new to running. Can I try one of your sessions?

__A__: Yes! If you are a complete beginner, come along and try our Wednesday night Improvers Group. You will get expert advice from our Inprovers coach, Chris (aka “GPS”), on how to embark on your running adventure in a sociable and fun environment. Please see below for more information.

__Q__: I’m a runner and want to improve, can you help?

__A__: Yes! Whether you are a recreational runner or a competitive athlete we have a range of training sessions to suit you. If you can comfortably run 5k (3 miles), come along and try our Monday night 4 mile social group. As a rule of thumb, if you do the Cheltenham parkrun in 30 minutes or less, this is the group for you. You can also try our Wednesday night Improvers Group.

If you area more experienced runner, we have a number of Monday night 6 mile groups ranging from 9:30 minutes per mile (~1 hour for a 10k) to sub-6 minutes per miile (~40 minutes for a 10k). Our experienced group leaders will guide you round at an even (but testing!) pace. You can also try our Wednesady night Competitive Group.

### Road Run – Monday 6.30pm CLC Sports Centre

We meet at the CLC Sports Centre on Monday evenings at 18:30 and offer two distances: a 4 mile sociable run and a 6 mile run at a range of paces. If you would like to try a Monday session, please come along to the CLC Sports Centre at 18:25 on Monday evening and ask to speak to one of our club captains. You can also email us at training@clcstriders-runningclub.co.uk or contact us on social media via facebook or twitter. We do appreciate that coming along to your first training session could be nervous but we will do everything we can to give you the usual CLC Striders big warm welcome.

All our routes are circular, starting and finishing at our base <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cheltenham,+Gloucestershire+GL50+2NX/@51.8996855,-2.0905991,17.26z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48711b750b7cf72f:0x18adca3553c78bca?hl=en">CLC Sports Centre</a>. We also ensure that each group sticks together to make the session enjoyable and safe. During the winter, we ask that people wear high visibility items to help other people see that the group is coming along the paths and pavements of Cheltenham.

### Speed Work – Wednesday 6.30pm CLC Sports Centre

Speed work is for all abilities; it is a common misconception that it is only for the pros. Recreational runners will see tangible benefits in their fitness and performance. We have two groups; an improvers group and a competitive group:

#### Improvers Group

This group is designed for athletes who may not yet feel confident enough to compete for the club, especially in Cross Country League fixtures, but who want to improve their running. The aim of this group is to help members to achieve their running goals; to compete if they wish to do so, and progress to the Competitive Group.

#### Competitive Group

This group is designed for athletes who predominantly do compete and who want to fly the flag for the club especially in Cross Country League races, and for those who really want to become the best they can be at their selected distance. The sessions, especially over the winter months, will be progressive in volume and will have lots of variation.
