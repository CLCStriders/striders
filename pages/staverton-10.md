CLC Striders hold the Staverton 10 in January every year and with Race HQ being at The Aviator Inn, Gloucestershire Airport.
This is a popular road race as it is a flat, fast road race which is aimed at helping runners prepare for the Spring Marathon season. 2020’s race will be held on Sunday 26th January, 2020, with a start time of 09:00.

### Course Description

The race is a 2 lap course which heads out of the airport, and into Churchdown via Cheltenham Road East. From Churchdown the route passes Chosen Hill School and returns to the airport via a brief section through farmland.

This will be clearly marshalled. Please note that road closures have not been applied for so keep well to the left at all times. Please note that on the farmland section, good concentration is required due to uneven terrain. Also, there are likely to be cattle on the fields.
