CLC Striders hold the Staverton 10 in January every year and with Race HQ being at The Aviator Inn, Gloucestershire Airport. Ideal for runners preparing for the Spring Marathon season, this is a popular, flat and fast road race. 

### Date and Time

2023’s race will be held on Sunday 29th January 2023, with a start time of 09:00.

### Course Description

The race is a two-lap course. Starting at the airport, it heads out and westwards into Churchdown via Cheltenham Road East. From Churchdown, the route passes Chosen Hill School and returns to the airport via a brief section through farmland.
 
The entire route will be clearly signed and marshalled. Please note that road closures have not been applied for, so keep well to the left at all times. Please note that on the farmland section, the tracks are less even than the main roads and so extra concentration is required. Also, there can sometimes be cattle in the fields (which the marshals do their utmost to keep away from the route).

### Race day information

To help make your race day experience the best it can be, please read the helpful information below. 
 
If you cannot run, please do let us know before the day and we may be able to invite people from the waiting list to take up your place. We cannot guarantee we will be able to offer a refund if you cannot run, but we will do our best to transfer your place (and refund you if we can). 

Although Covid restrictions have been lifted, we would request that you do your best to observe a considerate measure of social distancing and try not to congregate on the day.  If you would feel more comfortable and safe, please wear a mask or face covering.  Please remember that you are fully responsible for being fit and healthy to take part in our event. If you have any Covid symptoms please exercise caution and do not travel and participate. 

As we are running under UK Athletic Rules and do not have full road closures along the route, wearing of personal listening devices is strictly prohibited. This is because you need to clearly hear traffic, runners overtaking and/or marshals’ instructions. Any runner seen wearing such a device will be disqualified. 

#### Important points for race day
 
* Please collect your race number and timing chip from Race HQ between 08:00 and 08:45 – this will be outside The Aviator Inn (Postcode: GL51 6SR). Any runner who does not collect their race number by 08:45 will have their place transferred to anyone from the waiting list that is ready to race. 
 
* When you get your race number, please write your name, emergency contact details and any important medical information on the reverse of your number. Please make sure your number is clearly visible on the front of your vest throughout the race. We need to ensure that we see your number at the finish line to give you an accurate time. 
 
* You will be given a timing chip which should be looped through your shoe laces. Instructions for fitting these to your shoes will be at Race HQ. It is important that you wear this as we be relying on chip timing only for the results. Without this, you will not get a result. 
 
* Please follow the instructions from our car park marshals upon arrival. (More information about car parking can be found below.)
 
* Portaloos will be available for race participants outside the Aviator Inn. Please no not use the toilets in the airport buildings or the Aviator Inn. Unfortunately, no changing facilities or kit storage is available.
 
* The race starts at 09:00 outside of the main airport terminal building. 
 
* Runners will be disqualified if they wear headphones (UKA Rules). 

* For the wellbeing of marshals, runners who do not complete the first lap within 1 hour will be asked to stop the race.
 
* At the finish, don’t forget to return the timing chip. 
 
* Join us at Race HQ (outside the Aviator Inn) for prize-giving afterwards. 
 
* Please support our sponsors, without whom we wouldn't be able to put on this race. They are: The Aviator Inn, hosting us; Up & Running, providing all of the race numbers; and Churchdown Co-Op, providing post-race bananas. 
 
Your race number entitles you to 15% off at Up & Running (one of our race sponsors) for two weeks after the race. So please keep hold of it and pop in!

#### Route

Route Map: [Map]({{ page.routeMap }}) & [Strava Route](https://www.strava.com/routes/7184956)

#### Race details / at the start

The start line for the race is opposite the main entrance to the Gloucestershire Airport building. Please remember that the Airport will be operational, so be mindful that vehicles will be using the roads around the airport. 
 
The race will start at 09:00 and will be run under UK Athletics rules. The race consists of two, anti-clockwise laps of roughly five miles each. However, the first section is run in the opposite direction around the airport perimeter roads, before a sharp U-turn. During this first section, runners are strongly advised to run on the left-hand side of the road to allow enough space for runners returning in the opposite direction. 
 
There will be a large number of CLC Striders members out marshalling on the course. They will be there to guide you around the course. We have also placed a number of directional arrows and mile markers too. Note that marshals are not permitted to direct traffic as road users have priority. 
 
There will be one drinks station outside The Aviator Inn, at about five miles. We are aiming to make this a low waste event so please carry your own water bottle if you need it. There will be the facility to refill your bottle at the water station.
 
#### At the Finish

After you cross the finish line, you will notice a group of timekeepers. Please do not distract the them, as they need to concentrate and ensure everyone gets the correct result. 
 
If you drop out of the race, please notify one of the officials at the finish line so that we know you haven’t got lost out on the course. 
 
Once you have crossed the finish line, please make sure you return the timing chip. 
 
### Car Parking

From 07:45, members of CLC Striders will be helping runners find suitable car parking. We will be using the main terminal car park of the airport along with a number of car parks at the Bamfurlong Industrial Estate. We request that runners do not park outside of Race HQ as we would like to ensure that these spaces are reserved for race officials, volunteers and other customers of The Aviator Inn. We would suggest that runners allow plenty of time to walk from the car park as some of our secondary parking at the office car parks are a 10 minute walk from Race HQ. Please do not park anywhere other than guided by the marshals, participants must not park on any of the airport grounds.

We are aware of roadworks taking place on the south of Bamfurlong Lane resulting in the closure of the bridge across the M5. Access to Staverton airport is therefore via the B4036 only using the [route detailed on the map](/images/2023/01/2023-01-07-Staverton-10-access.jpeg "route detailed on the map") .
