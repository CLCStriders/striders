- [Staverton 10 Mile](/staverton-10) - course records and previous results

Unfortunately the recent installation of a new cycle path along the route on Old Gloucester Road has rendered the Staverton 10 route inoperable - the route between Bamfurlong Lane and the Hare and Hounds Pub is too narrow to safely enable participants to run. The Staverton 10 route has therefore sadly been retired.
